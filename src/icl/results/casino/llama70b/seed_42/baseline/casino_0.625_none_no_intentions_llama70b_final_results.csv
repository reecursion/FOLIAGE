Agent 2: Well I planned on spending a few extra days here at this camping site with my family so the extra water will really come in handy for me over the next few days.  I can offer you an extra package of firewood to keep the 3 packages of water.
Agent 1: That makes total sense.  I will let you keep all 3 of the water packages.  If I take the extra firewood for all 3 packages then I can probably boil a lot of the water to get the harmful bacteria out.  I really appreciate your generosity 🙂.
Agent 2: No problem.🙂  So I will keep the 3 packages of water and, since I am giving you all 3 packages of the firewood I will take back the 1 food package and keep all 3 of the food packages.
Agent 1: I would still like at least 1 package of the food please.  There has been a lot of rain in the area, but I think some poisonous mushrooms maybe prevalent in the area, so to be extra cautious I would like a little spare food on hand.

Great deal!
Agent 1: i too i am bad at cooking and i will spend a longer time in the woods so i will need atleast 2 foods, 2 firewood and 1 water
Agent 2: But I have more mouths to feed here so I will give you one of the foods, but then need 2 firewood and then take back 1 of the waters.
Agent 1: your dogs could probably hunt for something for you guys. and i would be in the would for a very long time

Agent 2: I think that that is acceptable to me. I want to make sure we both understand: I get 1 Water, 2 Firewood, 2 Food Packages. You get 2 Waters, 1 Firewood, 1 Food Package. I will have to ration my water, but I think the extra comfort is worth it. Does this work for you?

Agent 1: I am actually very much in need of water. I fell while I was hiking during this trip. I have a really bad wound I need to clean on my leg.

Agent 2: oh no!!!!! sounds like you shouldnt be camping at all. thats insane that happened. youre definitely in my thoughts. uhm i guess i have no choice since your situation is dire. so to be clear youre saying i can have two water and you can have two wood? if so thats ok with me

Agent 1: hy thats my offer
Agent 2: Hi there.. I'm sorry, I didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages, I believe.  So, here's the situation.. I think I can get by with less firewood as I'm a Floridian and prefer it cooler anyway.. also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but I'm definitely interested in as much water as possible.. both for cooking and cleaning purposes, as well as drinking, of course.  🙂
Agent 1: okay so what do you suggest
Agent 2: Well, I recognize you're gonna need water too.. so I'd love to take 2 of them, giving you one and I'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food.. that way we all ensure we have enough.. you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but I think its best for both of us 🙂
Agent 1: i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods
Agent 2: Yeah, sorry, that's not going to work out for me.  I'm going to need at least 2 bottles of water, 1 food packet, and one firewood.. again, this does leave you with two each on the food and the firewood, which are both very important things for this camping trip!

Agent 2: Hello.  I'm actually not doing too well.  There have been a few problems and I will need some of the extra packages.  I'll need two of the waters, 2 of the firewood and 2 of the food.
Agent 1: I'm sorry to hear that you are not doing well.  I've also have some issues.  On the way up to the camp site, all of my clean water spilled in the car.  I was really hoping to be able to get all of the available water.  Why aren't you well?  I hope it's not serious.  ☹️
Agent 2: Oh, that's terrible.  I'm sorry that happened.  I need the water for my child.  They seem dehydrated and disoriented.  My husband has also caught a cold and has been having chills.  I thought the extra firewood would help him feel better.
Agent 1: Oh my gosh.  You are not having an easy trip.  If your children are dehydrated and disoriented, perhaps you should get them to emergency care immediately.  I would like to provide you will all of the water in the meantime, but that would leave me with none at all.  I wouldn't have your husband out of the tent with chills.  Perhaps you should keep him bundled in your cabin.  I forgot my portable propane grill - so I would need some firewood.  How about I take 2 waters, 1 firewood and all of the food?
Agent 2: Oh dear, you spilled your water and forgot your grill?  You mentioned that you had a car.  Perhaps you could take a quick drive to grab some extra water.  For now, I definitely agree that you need 1 extra water and 1 firewood.  I will need 2 of the extra food portions though.  How does that sound?
Agent 1: Wish it was an easy car ride.  We're miles and miles from a store and it's getting dark.  I don't do well driving in the dark.  I think we might be getting close to agreement.  As I understand it:  you would get 1 water, 2 firewood and 2 food portions?  Is that correct?
Agent 2: Actually, I suggested that you would get 1 water, 1 firewood and 1 food portion.  I can compromise with you though.  I would like 2 water portions, 1 firewood and 1 food.
