Agent 2: how about I give you 2 waters and 1 food package in exchange for all your firewood?
Agent 1: I'm afraid that will not work for me. I have hypothyroidism, so I am intolerant to cold temperatures. I was also planning on taking a swim in the river. I would prefer to take two firewood & one food package, & you may have the three waters, two food packages, & one firewood.
Agent 2: I'm afraid I also have need of the firewood. I have anaemia so i get cold easily so I need to make sure I have adequate firewood or i may freeze at night. I also have a thin clothing so they wont provide adequate warmth. How about all of my water and 2 food for all of the firewood?
Agent 1: Seeing as we both have a medical-necessity for the firewood, it's rather unfair that either one of us take ALL of the firewood. I felt that I was being rather generous with my previous offer.
Agent 2: you are right we both need the wood, how about i give 1 wood, all of my water and 2 food and you give 2 wood and 1 food?
Agent 1: Where are you camping? Perhaps we can compromise by having our tents nearby each other, which would be like we each get three firewood? I am not willing to trade my package of marshmallows, though. user1 (mturk_agent_1):
