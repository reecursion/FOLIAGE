Agent 1: I am too.  I've been thinking of this since COVID.  I hear we have some materials to share between the two of us.  What are you thinking?  For me, I am from the South so I get cold easily 🙂 so firewood is my main priority.
Agent 2: Perfect!  I'm a northerner, so the firewood is all yours!  I'll need lot's of water to keep hydrated after the hike, and I'll probably be pretty hungry too.
Agent 1: My spouse calls me a water buffalo so I'm pretty water dependent if you couldn't tell.
Agent 2: That's good.  Best way to stay healthy is with water.  How about you take 1 water and all the firewood?

I'm with a couple other Floridians so we're not really too worried about firewood as we prefer it cooler, anyway.. and we know the lake is nearby that's stocked with trout for eating if necessary (and of course some fresh water's there, too) - so.. I can tell you that I could go totally without Firewood if I needed to.. I'd rather not, but I could.

Agent 2: Hi there.  I'm hoping we can make a deal about me getting firewood.  I get really cold at night and I'd love to have my fire still going in the morning for coffee - I'd gladly share some if you pop by my campsite.
Agent 1: I am in dire need of firewood myself. I was planning on bringing food that needed to be cooked over flame. 😮
Agent 2: Well maybe we can find a way to split it!  This isn't a problem we can't solve.  Are you in need of food too, then?
Agent 1: That would be great! I don't need food as much as I am in need of firewood, to be honest.
Agent 2: I brought purification tablets so I can make do with rainwater or river water.  How about you?

The baby needs water for her bottles and I need an additional bundle of firewood to warm her bottles.
Agent 2: Hi, I appreciate your response. I would like to compromise. I will give you the bundle of firewood you requested as well as the 2 packages of food. However, I would like to get 2 jugs of water. I have 2 other adults with me on this trip and they require more water to stay hydrated than a baby would.
Agent 1: That actually sounds pretty good to me. 🙂
Agent 2: 🙂
Agent 1: So, it looks like we have reached a compromise.

Agent 1: Yes, I'd definitely be interested. How are you doing?
Agent 2: Not bad, not bad. How are you. What's on your mind for camping?
Agent 1: I'm doing well. We're desperately needing wood. We didn't realize how cold it would be as it is our first time here. There is none around our area so we are really concerned about staying warm especially at night. We also forgot a bag of food, so that's another need for us.
Agent 2: True. Turns out i'm dealing with similar situation, we didn't expect weather to be as cold, so extra wood is on my mind as well. Everyone might need to go to bed earlier and cook food that cooks short time since we low on wood !
Agent 1: Yes, that's very true. I would be willing to give up water for more firewood.
Agent 2: I like that. I could help you out. I'd be interested in giving you some extra food for extra water. We like to go far from campsite to hike and get up to high elevation, so i need to pack extra water just in case.

Agent 1: I did not know you wanted water. Ok, that's great so I will take all 3 extra packages of food.As for the water I would like 2 waters because my dog is coming along with us for our trip and extra water for him will be needed.
