Agent 2: Ohh nice.I also have the same issue around here.The thirst for water is growing high than ever due to drought
Agent 1: Well, that's a bummer. How are you set for food? While I wouldn't mind a bit more, I'm in pretty good shape there, so I'd be willing to trade it for water. I'd hate to leave without getting a good hike in.
Agent 2: Hun,It's a bit of a fair deal,but due to the condition here i will need a bit more of water though foo cannot be overlooked also for survival but still to survive we take chances.So do you mind me giving you a package of food and u trading 2 pakages of water?.

Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

Conversation:
Agent 2: Hi, it is nice to be going camping. I do not have a very good sleeping bag and I can get cold at night. It would be nice to have extra firewood. I dont eat much so I do not need much extra food. Would you be willing to give me two packages of firewood for a package of food?
Agent 1: I enjoy camping as well. However, my campsite seems to be a bit chilly at night. I'd be willing to part with some firewood, yet I'd need quite a bit of food to compensate. I also have a stream nearby so water is plentiful if you need that as well.
Agent 2: I may be able to do something with regards to food. Do you have enough water?
Agent 1: I have more water than I need. How is your water supply?
Agent 2: I could use some more water as I get dehydrated easily. Since you have enough, I could give you and extra package of food for your water.
Agent 1: That sounds like a deal, what would you like to do as far as the firewood goes?
Agent 2: I really need to keep warm with my not so good sleeping bag.‚òπÔ∏è I would be willing to do this. I get two packages of firewood and three packages of water and I will give you two packages of food and one package of firewood. You have plenty of water so you will not miss that..
Agent 1: This sounds good to me, unless you would be able to part with three packages of food?

Agent 1: Same! I'm a little worried about some of my supplies though. What about you?
Agent 2: Likewise! What are you most in need of?
Agent 1: Well, I'm camping up on a snowy mountain and I gave some of my food away to hikers who were passing me and were very tired and hungry, so I'd really like to get some more food. Firewood would be useful too, although I do have a thick coat and a sleeping bag. I plan on melting the snow to get water, so I don't think I'll need that too much. And you?
Agent 2: I have the same needs. I have a low metabolism, so I need food and firewood to keep me warm and energized. Water I plan on filtering elsewhere.
Agent 1: Ok, well, I'd like to help. How about if I take 2 food and 1 firewood and 2 water, and you can keep the rest?

Agent 2: Hello, I am doing well, I am excited about my upcoming camping trip, how are you ?
Agent 1: I good thank you.  Yes, I am excited about this trip but I have been worrying about how I can get more firewood.  A raccoon came and stole mine this morning from the campsite.  So would it be alright if I kept all 3 firewoods?
Agent 2: No, I have all of my children here with me, they are all afraid of the dark so must burn the fire all night, as I brought no additional source of lighting.
Agent 1: ok, fair enough.  How about I take 2 firewood as 1 should do you for a couple nights. I also have small children with me and would like to have the fire burning at all times to keep the bugs away.
Agent 2: I really dont see giving up that much of the wood as I cannot risk running out myself. We are camping way too far out to get access to additonal lighting. I tell you what if you will let me have 2 of the fire wood I would be willing to give you two of the food items. I know that racoon probably took your food as well!!
Agent 1: Okay that is a deal. I would like 3 water as well because my campsite water is very dirty. I would like to have bottled water to take my medicine with and we forgot to pack it.

Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

OUTCOME: {agent1:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}, agent2:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}}

Remember: Each resource must sum to exactly 3 units across both agents.","assistant<|end_header_id|>
