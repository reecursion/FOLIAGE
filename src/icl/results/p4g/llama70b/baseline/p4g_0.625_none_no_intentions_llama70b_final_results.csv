DONATION: NO

Reasoning:

* The persuadee seems somewhat unengaged and unenthusiastic throughout the conversation, responding with brief and neutral statements.
* The persuader fails to establish a clear connection between the persuadee's stated interests (environment and food system) and the charity being promoted (Save the Children).
* The persuadee is not asked to make a specific donation, and the conversation does not build towards a clear ask.
* The persuader's own response to the question about how much they would donate is vague and unconvincing (""I'm not sure, I already donate my time"").
* The conversation takes a sudden turn towards a different topic (the crisis in Syria), which may be emotionally impactful but does not create a clear sense of urgency or opportunity for the persuadee to take action.",no,no,1,0.0

Persuadee: Hello
Persuader: So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children.
Persuader: Have you heard of that charity before?
Persuadee: Know I have not.
Persuadee: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries.
Persuader: It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: What is the organization called?
Persuader: It's called Save the Children.
Persuader: It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat.
Persuader: It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat.
Persuader: Do you donate much to charity now?
Persuadee: O I have heard of Save the children.
Persuadee: I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.
Persuadee: Currently I do not donate to charities.
Persuadee: I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.
Persuadee: I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.
Persuader: I understand.
Persuader: I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend.
Persuader: I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday.
Persuader: However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out.
Persuader: It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.
Persuadee: I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.
Persuadee: I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.
Persuader: I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding.
Persuader: If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?
Persuader: Yes, I believe so.
Persuader: Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task

DONATION: NO

Reasoning: Although the persuadee seems sympathetic and interested in the cause, there are several indications that they might not make a donation on the spot:

1. The persuadee initially expresses skepticism about the organization's legitimacy and effectiveness (""It's hard to ensure the money goes to the actual children tho"").
2. They don't ask about specific ways to donate or request more information about the organization's donation process.
3. They shift the conversation to hearing stories about the children helped by the organization, rather than taking concrete action.
4. The persuader's approach is somewhat pushy and accusatory (""You should that too. I am sure you are spending money in things you do not really need""), which might create resistance in the persuadee.

The persuader's attempts to alleviate these concerns have been met with skepticism, and the persuadee has even brought up a specific example of the charity's CEO's high salary, which suggests that they are not convinced by the persuader's assurances.

Reasoning:

* The persuadee seems engaged and interested in the conversation, asking questions and responding with empathy (""Oh wow, shocking news"").
* However, the persuadee does not express a clear intention to donate, and their questions are more focused on gathering information about the organization rather than indicating a willingness to contribute.
* The persuadee's response to the question about how many children have been helped is positive (""Thats awesome!""), but this does not necessarily translate to a commitment to donate.
* When asked how much they would like to donate, the persuadee is put on the spot, and it is unclear whether they are prepared to make a donation at that moment.

Reasoning: Although the persuadee seems mildly interested in the organization and acknowledges that it sounds ""decent"", they do not express a strong emotional connection or commitment to making a donation. Additionally, when asked about the cost of a donation, the persuader does not provide a clear answer, which may deter the persuadee from making a decision on the spot.

* Initially deflect the request by stating they prefer to donate to local charities
* Ask multiple questions about the organization, its location, and how the funds are used, indicating they are not yet convinced
* Do not make a firm commitment to donate, instead saying ""I could maybe help""
* Continue to ask questions about the persuader's involvement with the organization, which may indicate they are skeptical or need more information before making a decision.

Reasoning: Although the persuader has provided some compelling information about the charity and its mission, the persuadee has expressed several concerns about the legitimacy and transparency of the charity. Specifically, they asked multiple times about the percentage of donations that go directly to the children, and the persuader's responses seemed inconsistent or unclear. Additionally, the persuadee mentioned the existence of scams and their skepticism about charities, which suggests that they are not yet convinced to make a donation. The persuader's attempts to guilt-trip the persuadee into making a donation (""They need your help. They need your donation more than you do honestly."") may also have had a negative effect.

Persuader: How much do you know about Save the Children?
Persuadee: I know that it is a charity.
Persuadee: I think I have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.
Persuader: Were you aware that Save the Children assists both children in the U.S. as well as foreign countries?
Persuadee: No.
Persuadee: I figured they just tried to help children in under developed countries.
Persuadee: That's great that they help people in the U.S. as well!
Persuadee: I think it's important to help children from our country and also others.
Persuader: Yes, not only do we help out with literacy and school related causes, but also with feeding, shelter, and disaster relief for children all over the world.
Persuadee: That's wonderful!
Persuadee: Are you a top rated charity?
Persuadee: How much goes to administrative costs?
Persuader: We are a top rated charity, and have been around for nearly 100 years!
Persuader: Nearly 90% of our funds go straight to children, with the remainder going to fundraising costs and only 5% for admin costs.
Persuadee: Wow!  That's really great!
Persuadee: I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.
Persuadee: I think this is a fair percentage to have.
Persuader: We try our best to keep the children first, and have done so in aiding millions of children over the years.

Persuadee: I think so, it sounds familiar.
Persuadee: it is a nonprofit charity if i recall.
Persuadee: What exactly do they do?
Persuader: Save The Children helps kids from around the world by taking contributions from generous patrons. Kids from countries that have been stricken by poverty, violence, and other blights.
Persuadee: What countries has the charity worked in recently?
Persuader: Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now.
Persuader: Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.
Persuadee: Wow that sounds like a really robust program.
Persuadee: How long has Save the Children been around?
Persuader: It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK.

Persuader: A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want.
Persuader: Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars.
Persuader: For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.
Persuadee: I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question.
Persuadee: What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses
Persuader: Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.
Persuadee: That's pretty impressive!
Persuadee: Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.
Persuader: We do it for them, not for ourselves.

DONATION: YES

My reasoning is as follows:

* The persuader has established a rapport with the persuadee through small talk and sharing a personal experience (the 5k fun run).
* The persuadee has shown interest in the charity and asked follow-up questions, indicating engagement and concern for the cause.
* The persuader has provided clear and compelling information about the charity's mission and the specific needs of the children it supports.
* The persuadee has asked practical questions about how the money is used, suggesting they are considering making a donation.
* The persuader has addressed the persuadee's concerns and provided reassurance about the charity's work.
* The persuader has ended with a positive note, emphasizing that ""every little bit counts"", which can create a sense of urgency and motivation to act.
