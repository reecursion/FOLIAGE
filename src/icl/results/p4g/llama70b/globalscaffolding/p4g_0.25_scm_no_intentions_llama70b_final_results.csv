My reasoning is as follows:

* The persuadee (EE) shows low warmth, which suggests a lack of emotional investment in the conversation.
* Although EE shows competence by asking informed questions, their responses are brief and don't indicate a strong sense of enthusiasm or commitment to the cause.
* EE mentions not having done a lot of research on the charity, which suggests a lack of prior interest or engagement.
* The persuader (ER) doesn't provide a strong emotional appeal or a clear call-to-action, which might have helped to overcome EE's reservations.

My reasoning is as follows:

* The persuadee has shown interest in learning more about the charity, but has not yet been presented with a clear ask or emotional appeal that would motivate them to make a donation on the spot.
* The persuader has only provided a brief introduction to the charity, and has not yet established a personal connection or sense of urgency that would prompt the persuadee to take immediate action.
* The persuadee's initial lack of knowledge about the charity suggests that they may need more convincing or education before making a donation.

The persuadee has asked a question about the organization, which suggests curiosity, but it's still a relatively neutral and informational exchange.
