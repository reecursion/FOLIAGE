Persuadee: i am also a follower of Unicef, are you familiar
Persuader: Yes, I've heard of Unicef.
Persuader: Another great organization.
Persuader: One thing I love about Save the Children is that they have very high ratings from third-party reportings.
Persuader: I know when I donate to them that my money is being used wisely!
Persuadee: interesting, what do the ratings represent
Persuader: The ratings are from different companies such as Better Business Bureau and American Institute of Philanthropy.
Persuader: They actually get the financial reports from the IRS to confirm the accuracy in where the funds are going.
Persuadee: very good...are you interested in other charities involved with children
Persuader: I have given to other organizations in the past, such as World Vision, but Save the Children is really important to me right now.
Persuader: There is such a lack of support right now in developing countries, and Save the Children really focuses on that.
Persuadee: i happen to favor unicef since my kids collect for halloween and kids count monies as part of class project.
Persuader: I totally understand that.
Persuader: One thing I like about Save the Children is that it isn't just global but also focuses on kids in need here in the USA, especially the poverty-torn cities.

Persuadee: Nutrition is important
Persuader: so will you donate to keep the children nourished and kept safe
Persuadee: I typically donate to local charities by giving food or cash.
Persuadee: I sometimes question charities that I don't really know
Persuader: well with this charity we all know it is to help to save the children and I agree you should question other donations because together we can help keep the children nourished
Persuadee: I just worry money I donate doesn't get to the children.
Persuader: I agree because as you have seen the commercials of the individual holding a little child asking for donations and all he is doing is getting to play with peoples emotions well with our organization we cut the cost of an actor and use that money to help the children
Persuadee: That's fantastic.
Persuadee: And how do you make sure some local warlord doesn't get in the way of the charity?
Persuader: well we all know there is warlords everywhere even in the USA but we try our very best for our food items to reach the children
Persuadee: Warlords in the USA get elected to political office unfortunately.

Persuader: I was going to make a plea and ask if you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.
Persuader: It helps kids in need.
Persuader: I would hate to think a child would die with no food when I could ask people to help.
Persuader: Can you donate part of today's pay?
Persuader: Even a bit?
Persuadee: It's so sad to me that anyone should go without food in our modern world.
Persuadee: So I would definitely be willing to help.

Persuader: How much of today's pay can you give?

Persuadee: Please tell me more.
Persuader: These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help.

Persuadee: That's awesome!
Persuadee: Do you know when the charity began?
Persuader: It was founded way back on April 15, 1919!
Persuader: A charity with that kind of history shows that it has made an amazing impact.
Persuader: Just last year they helped a total of 155 million children!
Persuadee: That is very impressive.
Persuadee: Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?
Persuader: The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need.
Persuadee: That is awesome.
Persuader: I know I was surprised by those numbers.
Persuader: A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.
Persuader: That's important to me in a charity.
Persuadee: Yes, definitely.
Persuadee: Unfortunately some ""charities"" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.
Persuader: That's the truth.
Persuader: That's why it's so important to do research before donating.
Persuader: Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.
Persuader: For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.
Persuader: It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.
Persuader: Super helpful.
Persuadee: That's very helpful.
Persuadee: It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money.
Persuadee: That way nobody can question anything.
Persuader: Oh yeah.
Persuader: When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.
Persuader: Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs!
Persuader: The rest goes to ""fundraising, management, and general"" as the website says. The conversation begins with ER introducing Save the Children to EE, who is initially unfamiliar but receptive. ER employs a strategy of providing detailed information and statistics to build credibility and highlight the charity's transparency and impact. EE responds positively, expressing admiration and agreement. As the conversation progresses, both speakers emphasize the importance of transparency and responsible financial management in charities. ER maintains a persuasive tone, reinforcing the charity's integrity, while EE remains engaged and supportive throughout.","assistant<|end_header_id|>
