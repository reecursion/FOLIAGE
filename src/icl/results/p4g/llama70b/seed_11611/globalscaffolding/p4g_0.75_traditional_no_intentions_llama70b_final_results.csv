DONATION: YES

Reasoning:

* The persuadee (EE) has shown empathy and concern for less fortunate children, indicating a potential willingness to help.
* EE has expressed interest in learning more about Save the Children and has mentioned a desire to help children, which suggests a positive inclination towards the organization.
* Although EE has raised a concern about the legitimacy of the organization, this is a common objection that can be addressed by the persuader (ER). ER can provide more information about the organization's reputation, transparency, and impact to alleviate EE's concerns.
* EE has also mentioned a history of donating to charities, which suggests that they are open to making donations to causes they believe in.

Persuadee (EE): I cuddle babies in the NICU.
Persuader (ER): That's adorable.
Persuader (ER): How did you get involved in an opportunity like that?
Persuader (ER): I imagine hospitals are very strict about who gets to be with the little ones.
Persuadee (EE): A friend has been doing it for awhile, and I've always been interested.
Persuadee (EE): There is quite a bit of training and background checks, but it's worth it!

Persuader (ER): Do you have a moment?
Persuadee (EE): Sure!
Persuadee (EE): As you can tell, it's something I'm very concerned about!
Persuader (ER): Some people are born really well-off.
Persuader (ER): Some are born not well-off, but they can reasonably expect enough food to eat and a place to live.
Persuader (ER): And there are some who are born so destitute that they can go for several weeks in hunger and/or not have a safe place to live or sleep.
Persuader (ER): How does that make you feel?
Persuadee (EE): It makes me feel like life is so unfair, and those of us who can help, should.
Persuader (ER): Have you ever heard of the charity, Save the Children?
Persuadee (EE): I don't believe so.
Persuader (ER): Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee (EE): Is it a well regulated agency?
Persuadee (EE): How much of donations go to the kids?

DONATION: NO

Reasoning: The conversation between ER and EE is more of a discussion about their shared interest in charities, particularly those focused on children, rather than a direct ask for a donation. While ER does mention Save the Children and its high ratings, the conversation does not build towards a specific ask or create a sense of urgency for EE to make a donation on the spot.

Persuader (ER): Have you heard of a charity called Save the Children?
Persuadee (EE): no
Persuader (ER): It is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuader (ER): The organisation promotes policy changes in order to gain more rights for young people, especially by enforcing the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child.
Persuader (ER): Alliance members co-ordinate emergency-relief efforts, helping to protect children from the effects of war and violence.
