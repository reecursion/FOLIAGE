Reasoning:

1. The persuadee (EE) asks multiple questions about the charity, indicating a cautious and informed approach to donating.
2. EE inquires about administrative costs, which suggests they are concerned about the charity's efficiency and transparency.
3. Although ER provides some information, they fail to address EE's question about GuideStar, which might raise doubts about the charity's credibility.
4. EE's question about what made ER interested in this charity and not another one may indicate that EE is not yet convinced about the charity's unique value proposition.
5. The conversation does not contain a strong emotional appeal or a sense of urgency, which are often effective persuasion tactics.
