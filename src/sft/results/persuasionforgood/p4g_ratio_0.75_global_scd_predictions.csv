Conversation:
Persuader: Hello how do you feel about the Save the Children charity?
Persuadee: I think it's a scam
Persuader: Oh no not at all they do tons of good  is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: I don't believe it.
Persuadee: There is no way to prove where all those funds go.
Persuadee: Plus there are starving children right here in america
Persuader: This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.
Persuader: They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: That is all your opinion.
Persuadee: You have no facts to back that up.
Persuader: Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.
Persuader: This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities
Persuadee: Like I said those are opinions.
Persuadee: There are no facts that prove that to be true.
Persuadee: There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.
Persuadee: I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization.
Persuadee: Infomercials don't impress me.
Persuader: How about the fact that they have been around for over 100 years scams do not stay around that long
Persuadee: Yes they do.
Persuadee: Have you ever heard of evangelism?
Persuadee: Again, you're only giving me an opinion.
Persuadee: I just can't see any good being done.
Persuader: What about the after school programs they have right here in the US or the head start programs that they offer in many rural areas?
Persuader: Just because it is not happening somewhere that you see everyday does not mean that it does not exsist.
Persuader: They actually fund the head start that my child will be going to till fall.
Persuader: Would you be willing to atleast donate some of what you are getting paid for this study?
Persuader: Right now save the children has a partnership that will double any donation made so any little bit would help
Persuadee: I would not be willing to donate, because I have never seen any impact made by their organization.
Persuadee: They also don't disclose their funds
Persuader: oh see I think I get it now your just selfish and dont care about kids is that about right?
Persuader: I mean because you personally have never seen it means it does not happen yeah totally.
Persuader: Stupid
Persuadee: No, I care about  kids in my community, who are in poverty.
Persuadee: I have never seen this organization help them.
Persuadee: I'd rather contribute my donation locally.
Persuadee: Rather than to a scam organization that only contributes in their infomercials.
Persuader: not to mention where are you getting your information?
Persuader: Saying that they do not disclose funds is an outright lie you can go to  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report and find it all right there.
Persuader: In just one year directly reached nearly 157,000 children through our U.S. emergency response and preparedness programs.
Persuader: I mean did you go talk to the families of the kids in your neighboorhood how you know they are not helping there???
Persuader: How do you know that nothing in your neighborhood is funded by them? , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER expressing support for a charity, while EE is skeptical and dismissive. ER attempts to persuade EE by providing information and examples of the charity's work, but EE remains unconvinced, questioning the transparency and impact of the organization. As the discussion progresses, ER becomes more frustrated and defensive, while EE maintains a firm stance, preferring local contributions.

Persuadee: How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?

Persuader: Have you heard of the Save the Children non profit organization?

Persuader: It is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: Ah ok very nice.
Persuadee: It sounds like a good charity.
Persuadee: Are you thinking of donating to it?
Persuader: I am thinking about it.
Persuader: I was hoping you would think about it too.
Persuader: It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuader: This makes me angry and was wondering if it did the same for you?
Persuadee: Yes, I definitely understand you.
Persuadee: It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country
Persuader: I know it is crazy.
Persuader: Sometimes I think about the little things I buy.
Persuader: Like yesterday I had a craving for candy so I bought a bag of smarties for $2.79.
Persuader: Sometimes I wonder how much it could help someone else instead of just satisfying my cravings.
Persuadee: Yes that is very true.
Persuadee: I usually donate $1.00 or $2.00 at restaurants or stores whenever they ask me if I would like to donate.

Persuader: I try to do the same if I have the extra money.
Persuader: Usually it is not something I am a strong believer in though.
Persuader: I really like helping others that in third world countries that have no idea what wealth is.
Persuadee: Yes I understand.
Persuadee: I have been to third world countries in South America and seeing the living conditions of some people is very tough.
Persuadee: The poverty there is a lot higher than what we are used to seeing and it can be shocking.

Persuader: Would you be willing to donate some of your hit money?
Persuadee: Yes, I would be willing to donate a small portion as well.

Persuadee: I typically donate to local charities by giving food or cash.

Persuadee: I just worry money I donate doesn't get to the children.

Persuader: Do you feel it is improtant to help the children of the world to get them a good meal atleast 2 times a day
Persuadee: Yes.
Persuadee: Nutrition is important
Persuader: so will you donate to keep the children nourished and kept safe
Persuadee: I typically donate to local charities by giving food or cash.
Persuadee: I sometimes question charities that I don't really know
Persuader: well with this charity we all know it is to help to save the children and I agree you should question other donations because together we can help keep the children nourished
Persuadee: I just worry money I donate doesn't get to the children.
Persuader: I agree because as you have seen the commercials of the individual holding a little child asking for donations and all he is doing is getting to play with peoples emotions well with our organization we cut the cost of an actor and use that money to help the children
Persuadee: That's fantastic.
Persuadee: And how do you make sure some local warlord doesn't get in the way of the charity?
Persuader: well we all know there is warlords everywhere even in the USA but we try our very best for our food items to reach the children
Persuadee: Warlords in the USA get elected to political office unfortunately.
Persuader: yes we know this and they run the country but that is the virtues of a free nation
Persuadee: As long as my donation gets to the children, I will donate to the charity
Persuader: Thank you for your donation as i guarantee you donation goes towards to the children
Persuader: How much would like to donate
Persuadee: Half of whatever I am going to get paid for this task, [Summary: The conversation begins with ER inquiring about EE's willingness to support children's nutrition, to which EE expresses general agreement but hesitance due to concerns about charity transparency. ER acknowledges these concerns and attempts to reassure EE by emphasizing the charity's direct impact. EE remains cautious, questioning the potential interference of local warlords. ER addresses these concerns, and EE ultimately agrees to donate, contingent on assurance that the funds reach the children. ER concludes by securing a commitment from EE.]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Persuader: I am so livid I just can't stand it right now.
Persuader: Parts of this world are so dark...
Persuader: how can we sit here and do nothing?
Persuadee: Do nothing about what?
Persuader: These poor suffering children!
Persuader: Did you know that 5.6 million children die each year due to treatable AND preventable diseases?

Persuader: Around the world!

Persuader: between preventing the spread of aids, reducing the infant mortality rate with proper education and vaccinations, and ensuring access and aid to proper nutrition so many children could be saved.
Persuadee: I totally agree.
Persuadee: There are people helping but its a drop in the bucket.
Persuadee: The kids dying is really disturbing.
Persuadee: They didn't choose that life.
Persuader: You are absolutely right.
Persuader: It is disturbing!
Persuader: And yes, it could seem like the aid is a drop in a bucket.
Persuader: However, if we can move the scale one iota and can consider that what that represents is one child having a week of meals or a healthy 3 months than wouldn't you agree that that would be worth any aid that we could provide?

Persuadee: Have you ever donated?

Persuadee: That is convenient!!!
Persuadee: I will definitely do that.
Persuadee: At least a portion of it.
Persuader: Incredible!

Persuader: Hello!
Persuadee: Hello
Persuader: So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children.
Persuader: Have you heard of that charity before?
Persuadee: Know I have not.
Persuadee: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries.
Persuader: It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: What is the organization called?
Persuader: It's called Save the Children.
Persuader: It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat.
Persuader: It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat.
Persuader: Do you donate much to charity now?
Persuadee: O I have heard of Save the children.
Persuadee: I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.
Persuadee: Currently I do not donate to charities.
Persuadee: I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.
Persuadee: I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.
Persuader: I understand.
Persuader: I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend.
Persuader: I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday.
Persuader: However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out.
Persuader: It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.
Persuadee: I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.
Persuadee: I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.
Persuader: I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding.
Persuader: If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?
Persuader: Yes, I believe so.
Persuader: Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task
Persuadee: Okay that is nice and simple.
Persuader: Absolutely!
Persuader: I agree.
Persuader: I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do.
Persuader: I don't know how much time we have left to chat, but it's been great to (electronically) meet you!
Persuadee: It has been great to electronically meet you too.
Persuadee: I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.
Persuader: Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns.
Persuader: So we'll need to chat a little bit more about donations; is there any particular issue going on with children in the world today that you've been following in the news or that you care more about?
Persuadee: So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States.
Persuadee: To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children.
Persuadee: For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you? , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER introducing the option to donate to a charity, with EE initially unfamiliar but open to learning more.

Persuader: Hi.
Persuader: How are you?
Persuadee: Hello, I'm fine.
Persuadee: How are you?
Persuader: I'm doing well. Thanks.
Persuader: Have you been using MTurk long?
Persuader: I've only just started in the last few days and I love it.
Persuader: It's pretty easy money most of the time.
Persuader: I'm Tommy, by the way.
Persuadee: Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy.
Persuadee: I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday.
Persuadee: It's great to earn extra money here and there.
Persuadee: I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Persuader: Well thanks, Cassidy.
Persuader: It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.
Persuader: I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.
Persuader: For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.
Persuader: And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.
Persuader: How about you, Cassidy?
Persuader: Do you like giving to charities?
Persuadee: I do enjoy donating to charities.
Persuadee: I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year.
Persuadee: And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university
Persuader: Aww, that's really considerate of you.
Persuader: I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.
Persuader: Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.
Persuader: I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.
Persuader: It's really sweet.
Persuader: Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children?
Persuadee: No, I haven't heard of Save the Children.
Persuadee: And its awesome that you help out those kids in need
Persuader: The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know?
Persuader: I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites.
Persuader: The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.
Persuader: It's really really sad what's going on over there.
Persuader: Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?
Persuadee: Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad.
Persuadee: Maybe I'll consider donating to them
Persuader: Well, personally, I've made about 8 dollars already here today, so I'm going to donate the 30 cents from this HIT to them.
Persuader: Did you know that there is an option to do that for this HIT?
Persuadee: No, I didn't know but thank you for telling me!
Persuadee: I think I might donate mine too!
Persuader: I say we do it together!
Persuader: See, Cassidy, no single one of us can fix all the problems in this world.
Persuader: There is too much suffering, too many children growing up in poverty and trauma.
Persuader: But together, if we stick together, if we put our money together, you'd be surprised how much we can change in this world.
Persuader: How many lives we can help. , [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly exchange of greetings and personal introductions, establishing a rapport between the speakers.

ER employs a persuasive strategy, emphasizing the impact of small donations and collective efforts.

Persuadee: Well, I don't have much money right now.

Persuader: Yes I agree.
Persuader: That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children.
Persuader: As you may know, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuader: Are there any organizations that you can reccomend?
Persuadee: I sponsor through World Vision.
Persuadee: I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going.
Persuadee: You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.
Persuadee: And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.
Persuadee: It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.
Persuader: I cannot thank you enough for that.
Persuader: How much do you donate on average annually?
Persuadee: Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually.
Persuadee: I also send him little care packages every so often.
Persuadee: At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc.
Persuadee: That will have such a big impact on their lives. , [Summary: The conversation begins with a straightforward inquiry about donating to a charity, with the respondent expressing willingness but financial limitations.

Persuader: Hello
Persuadee: Hi.
Persuader: Are you willing to donate to Save the Children?
Persuadee: Yes.
Persuadee: I would very much like to donate.
Persuader: how much are you willing to donate?
Persuadee: Well, I don't have much money right now.
Persuadee: All I can afford is $5.00.
Persuader: I think that is an excellent amount and would benefit Save the Children.
Persuader: For example,millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuader: Your donation will make an impact to better childrens' live around the world.
Persuadee: That's so horrible.
Persuadee: I wish I could give more.
Persuadee: I sponsor a poor child in India every month for $40.
Persuadee: I wish I could help all the children in the world.
Persuader: I would like to personally thank you for that.
Persuader: It is very thoughtful to donate to causes that benefit disadvantaged children.
Persuader: Your donation means a lot to that child in India
Persuadee: It is the least I can do for him.
Persuadee: Most people take for granted what they have in their lives, while there are so many thousands who do not even have the basic necessities.
Persuadee: Imagine not have clean water to drink.
Persuader: I cannot even begin to imagine that and clean water should be a basic right to every child on this planet.
Persuadee: I agree.
Persuadee: There is so much wasted in the world.
Persuadee: I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water.
Persuadee: If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.
Persuader: Yes I agree.
Persuader: That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children.
Persuader: As you may know, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuader: Are there any organizations that you can reccomend?
Persuadee: I sponsor through World Vision.
Persuadee: I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going.
Persuadee: You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.
Persuadee: And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.
Persuadee: It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.
Persuader: I cannot thank you enough for that.
Persuader: How much do you donate on average annually?
Persuadee: Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually.
Persuadee: I also send him little care packages every so often.
Persuadee: At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc.
Persuadee: That will have such a big impact on their lives., [Summary: The conversation begins with a straightforward inquiry about donating to a charity, with the respondent expressing willingness but financial limitations.

Persuader: Hello!
Persuadee: Hey
Persuader: So, are you interested in charities that help save the children?
Persuadee: Which children?
Persuader: What does the charity do exactly?
Persuader: Instead of the typical charities that help children in a far away land, we here use state of the art location technology to help children in need right in your own community so you can see your money at work personally
Persuadee: What would my money do exactly
Persuader: It would go to the three most important things that a child need.
Persuader: Food, shelter, and education.
Persuader: The majority of your donation would go towards education as that is often the most difficult to provide for the children
Persuadee: How would I know that the money is actually being used to help children and not just pocketed by the people that run the c harity
Persuader: We are completely transparent with our records, when you donate you will be given an account so you can track where every bit of your money goes, from your account all the way to the community.

Persuader: You know a lot of children in this world go through hardships, and your destiny is determined on where you are born?
Persuadee: I guess that is true.
Persuadee: I have never thought about destiny being determined by where you are born though.
Persuader: Yeah, so the chances of being born in the United States are very low, but you and I could have been born in a third world country where children are exploited
Persuadee: That really is terrible to think about.
Persuadee: We are pretty lucky to have been born in the United States.
Persuader: Yes of course, especially when the world is how it is today, and do you remember the debate about Kony in 2012?
Persuadee: I don't really remember much about it but I know the basics
Persuader: Yeah so people donated money to help children in need.
Persuader: Would you like to donate money to this charity?
Persuader: It's called Save The Children and it's really helpful for kids who aren't as lucky as us and are born in countries that are ravaged by war.
Persuadee: Is this a legit charity?
Persuadee: Do you have personal experience?
Persuader: Yes so what it is is that it's a charity that has international impact, for example where there is lack of support like Syria.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018, 1,000 children were killed or injured in the violence in Syria.
Persuader: We help with medical costs and funding volunteers.
Persuadee: That sounds important.
Persuadee: How much of a donation are you looking for?
Persuader: Well I wouldn't ask more than what a candy bar costs, I know we live in hard times right now.
Persuader: Anything between 10 to 50 cents helps.

Conversation:
Persuader: You know a lot of children in this world go through hardships, and your destiny is determined on where you are born?
Persuadee: I guess that is true.
Persuadee: I have never thought about destiny being determined by where you are born though.
Persuader: Yeah, so the chances of being born in the United States are very low, but you and I could have been born in a third world country where children are exploited
Persuadee: That really is terrible to think about.
Persuadee: We are pretty lucky to have been born in the United States.
Persuader: Yes of course, especially when the world is how it is today, and do you remember the debate about Kony in 2012?
Persuadee: I don't really remember much about it but I know the basics
Persuader: Yeah so people donated money to help children in need.
Persuader: Would you like to donate money to this charity?
Persuader: It's called Save The Children and it's really helpful for kids who aren't as lucky as us and are born in countries that are ravaged by war.
Persuadee: Is this a legit charity?
Persuadee: Do you have personal experience?
Persuader: Yes so what it is is that it's a charity that has international impact, for example where there is lack of support like Syria.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018, 1,000 children were killed or injured in the violence in Syria.
Persuader: We help with medical costs and funding volunteers.
Persuadee: That sounds important.
Persuadee: How much of a donation are you looking for?
Persuader: Well I wouldn't ask more than what a candy bar costs, I know we live in hard times right now.
Persuader: Anything between 10 to 50 cents helps.
Persuadee: That seems reasonable.
Persuadee: Yes I would like to make a donation.

Persuader: Hey!
Persuadee: Hi there, how's it going?
Persuader: So I wanted to explain a little about the Save the Children foundation, and why donating is important..
Persuader: It's a non governmental program that promotes the rights of children, and provides relief to these children in developing countries
Persuadee: They sound like an interesting charity.
Persuadee: How do they go about providing relief to the children?
Persuader: Well, they provide education, food, and clothing.
Persuader: Also, when a child is sick, they sometimes don't have the funds for proper healthcare, so unfortunately they die.
Persuader: It's really terrible.
Persuader: So many children die from hunger, and it's not fair.
Persuadee: Why are you passionate about this particular one?
Persuadee: There are so many charities that claim to do the same things.

Persuader: Hello.
Persuadee: Hello!
Persuader: I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people.
Persuader: Is that okay?
Persuader: To talk about suffering people and children for a minute?
Persuadee: I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.
Persuader: I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.
Persuader: If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.
Persuadee: I feel really torn about the crisis.

Persuader: No, that's relevant.
Persuader: Really relevant.
Persuader: It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.

Persuadee: I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.
Persuadee: They are the weak ones in my eyes.
Persuader: I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do?
Persuader: I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment.
Persuader: Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.
Persuadee: I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.
Persuadee: I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think. , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER cautiously introducing a sensitive topic, expressing concern for EE's comfort. As the discussion unfolds, both participants share personal reflections on the refugee crisis, with EE expressing skepticism about the efficacy of donations. ER, initially tasked with persuading EE to donate, finds themselves influenced by EE's perspective.

Conversation:
Persuader: hello
Persuadee: Hello tell me something good
Persuader: Have you heard about this awesome children's organization called Save the Children?
Persuadee: a little, what do they do?
Persuader: They are a very reputable international non-governmental organization dedicated to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuadee: cool, so what can i do
Persuader: The easiest way you can become involved with the organization initially is with monetary support.
Persuadee: ok so wht do you suggest?
Persuader: The easiest would be is to donated some or all of your incoming payment from this task today.
Persuadee: not so fast what does the money go to
Persuader: As I mentioned previously, for ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuader: For example Save the Children was one of the first to provide assistance after the Puerto Rico hurricanes to children whose parents had died in the storms with food and shelter.
Persuadee: oh wow ok how much do you suggest?
Persuader: You can choose any amount from a few cents up to the full amount you'd get for the task today.
Persuadee: ok  $1 it is
Persuader: Now I know I said any amount, but given the great cause this is, can you spare any more today?
Persuader: If you'd like to reconsider and read more about the organization you can view their website here :  URL
Persuadee: nope 1 is cool , [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly exchange and quickly shifts to ER introducing a charitable organization to EE. ER maintains a persuasive and informative tone, aiming to engage EE in supporting the cause financially. EE shows initial interest but remains cautious about the specifics of the donation's impact. Despite ER's attempts to encourage a larger contribution, EE decides on a modest donation, demonstrating a firm stance. ER provides additional resources for further consideration, but EE remains resolute.]<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Persuader: Hello how are you today?
Persuadee: I'm good.
Persuadee: How are you?
Persuader: I am doing great!
Persuader: I am here to let you know about this amazing international foundation called Save the Children that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support them in developing countries.
Persuadee: Please tell me more.
Persuader: These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need.
Persuader: All I ask is that you donate a portion of your task payment to this charity to help the children.
Persuadee: How do I know this charity is legit?
Persuader: You are free to look up any information you like at  URL
Persuadee: How much of the donations goto the children and the effort?
Persuader: 100% of your donation will go directly to Save the Children.
Persuader: Just think of it this way, instead of getting your morning coffee, or that bag of chips at lunch, you could donate $2 today and help ensure that 3 children get the care they need and food in their stomachs.
Persuadee: Does 100% go to the effort directly or does any of the monies go to employees like the director of the charity ect?
Persuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it all directly to Save the children.
Persuader: So it will go to pay for the flights to get the team over there, medicine, food, everything needed to help these children
Persuadee: What roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?
Persuader: Like I said earlier, 100% of your donation goes directly to helping these children.
Persuader: Look, already in 2018 alone, 1,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuader: They need your help.
Persuader: They need your donation more than you do honestly.
Persuader: What is $2 to you when that money can literally save lives over there?
Persuadee: There are many scams out there that take more to profit then to actually help the kids.

Persuader: You can go to the website I provided you earlier to know in your heart that this is not a scam.

Persuader: It's an international organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries, does that sound like something you'd get behind?
Persuadee: No thank you.
Persuader: May I ask why?
Persuader: Your help could really make a difference in a child's life, think of a child who didn't have enough to eat, just a small bit of help may have saved them, are you sure you're not interested?
Persuadee: I am already making a difference in many children lives.
Persuader: That's great, it sounds like it's an issue you really care about then, why not put some of that effort into a charity that's doing really great work like Save the Children?
Persuadee: I have donated 15 years of my life to charity
Persuader: I'm not asking you to donate years of your life, just a couple of cents if possible, is that something you could possibly do tonight?
Persuadee: No thank you
Persuader: You're probably on a computer right now, so you probably have quite a bit of money yourself, don't you think you could spare maybe 25 cents for some needy children around the world?
Persuadee: No thank you
Persuader: Do you have children yourself?
Persuader: What if your children were in a position these kids are in, wouldn't you want someone to help them?
Persuadee: Where are those childrens parent?
Persuader: If only they had parental support, but in war-torn countries like Syria their parents are being killed in wars or are fighting for their country, they have no help and that's why they need your support, please find it in your heart to just give a little bit tonight, that's all I'm asking.
Persuadee: My small change won't do a thing for those kids. , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER introducing a charity and attempting to engage EE's interest. EE initially shows curiosity but quickly declines to support the cause. ER persists with various persuasive strategies, including emotional appeals and hypothetical scenarios, to encourage EE to contribute. Despite ER's efforts, EE remains firm in their decision not to donate, citing prior charitable involvement and skepticism about the impact of small contributions. The conversation maintains a polite yet persistent tone from ER and a consistent refusal from EE.]<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Conversation:
Persuader: Hi, good morning!
Persuadee: Hello!
Persuader: Were you able to read a little about the charity Save the Children?
Persuadee: No, I didn't see anything.
Persuadee: I'm a little familiar with the charity though.
Persuader: Oh, awesome!
Persuader: Well, in case you didn't know, Save the Children is a great charity that focuses on helping kids around the world.
Persuader: They use almost 90% of all donations directly to help children in the areas of education, safety and emergency...
Persuadee: That's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children.
Persuadee: We know it's a problem not just in the United States.
Persuader: Yes, exactly.
Persuader: I'm not a fan of charities that keep a lot of their proceeds for themselves.
Persuader: That's one reason I really like this one.
Persuader: Do you think you would be willing to make a small donation to Save the Children today?
Persuadee: I most likely will.
Persuadee: I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there.
Persuadee: How do they help children in other parts of the world?
Persuader: Well, I know that the research team for this task can take a portion of our payment and send it directly to the Save the Children.
Persuader: It's quick and easy, and even thought it may not seem like a lot of money, I think that every penny counts.
Persuader: I believe we can contribute any portion of our payment: $0 - 0.30.
Persuadee: That would be alright.
Persuadee: Yes, I would like to donate at least one dollar to help Save the Children.
Persuader: Oh great!
Persuader: I don't know if there is a maximum we can contribute, but regardless, I think your support would be really appreciated.
Persuadee: I've heard on the news that many children around the world are with their families trying to escape wars.
Persuadee: I'm sure Save the Children helps them?
Persuader: I believe so.
Persuader: In places like the middle east or southern Asia, even the smallest donation can go a long way.
Persuadee: Yes, I agree.
Persuadee: It's difficult to watch the horrible things these children are going through.
Persuadee: Our children and grandchildren are so blessed.
Persuader: Yes, that's so true.
Persuader: I really wish more people could understand the importance of helping other, less fortunate then ourselves.
Persuadee: So, Save the Children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.
Persuadee: Good for them.
Persuadee: I wish other charities would follow, especially local ones.
Persuader: I believe they've been around for almost 100 years, so hopefully they have a pretty effecient organization. , [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly greeting and transitions into a discussion about the charity Save the Children. The initial focus is on sharing information about the charity's efficiency and impact. As the conversation progresses, ER employs a persuasive strategy by highlighting the charity's low overhead costs and the global need for aid, which resonates with EE. EE expresses a willingness to donate, showing a shift from initial unfamiliarity to active engagement, while both speakers maintain a collaborative and empathetic tone throughout.]<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Persuader: Would you like to donate to a Charity called Save the Children?

Persuader: Isn't that amazing?
Persuadee: That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.
Persuader: I know what you mean, I need to make money too.
Persuader: But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.
Persuadee: I can't work all day.
Persuadee: I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.
Persuader: Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.
Persuader: I have problems too.
Persuader: But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.
Persuader: I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.
Persuader: No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...
Persuadee: I have 10 cents I can give.
Persuader: That's awesome and generous!, [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly exchange, with ER expressing enthusiasm about volunteering.

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello, I would like to ask you to consider making a donation to Save the Children, an international NGO committed to promoting children's rights, and providing support for children in developing countries.
Persuadee: ohh how much donation would yoy expect?
Persuader: Your donation can be from $0 to all of the payment for this task.
Persuader: But before you decide hastily, I would like to remind you that Save the Children is one of the only charities doing what it does.
Persuader: There are children out there now without access to housing, clean water, education, and many other things we often take for granted.
Persuader: So please, consider thoughtfully whether you would be willing to make a sacrifice for the children of the world.
Persuadee: how do i trust the organiation?
Persuader: Save the Children is a world-renowned NGO with a trusted history and background.
Persuader: You can read about their successes on their website:   URL
Persuader: Also, they have been given high ratings from different charity watchodgs.
Persuadee: okay i will check it.. by the way how much did you donate?
Persuader: I donated $2, which is the maximum payment.
Persuader: I understand that everyone cannot commit to making a serious donation, but when we think about children suffering, we have a moral imperative to act in their defense.
Persuadee: okay i will donate $1
Persuader: If it's not too much to ask, I would like you to consider donating perhaps more.
Persuader: After all, there are children in Syria now growing up facing threats of violence everyday.
Persuader: Surely an additional dollar, which we might spend on a cup of coffee or a bag of chips, could more greatly aid them then us.
Persuadee: no i am okay with this amount
Persuader: OK, I will not force you to make a decision you don't want to.
Persuader: I will just ask you to consider how you would feel if your child was danger like many children are.
Persuadee: actually i am not donating like this.. if i would like to donate money i will give food and clothes to the kids directly
Persuader: While that is possible in a local community, it fails to take into account the suffering of kids in developing countries around the world, a specialty of Save the Children.
Persuader: Save the Children maximizes the efficiency of donations so that every dollar makes a difference.
Persuader: Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?
Persuadee: yes i am very much sure. , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER attempting to persuade EE to donate to a charity, employing emotional appeals and emphasizing the organization's credibility. EE shows initial curiosity but remains cautious and skeptical, questioning the organization's trustworthiness. ER responds with reassurances and personal commitment, but EE remains firm on a minimal donation. Despite ER's continued appeals and attempts to evoke empathy, EE ultimately decides against increasing the donation, preferring direct local contributions, and remains resolute in this decision.]<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Persuader: I've just been reading about a charity called Save the Children.
Persuader: Have you heard of it?
Persuadee: I've heard a little bit about it but don't know too much.
Persuader: From what I've read, it's a nonprofit that helps children in difficult situations around the world.

Persuadee: Oh wow!
Persuadee: That's incredible.
Persuadee: I wasn't aware that they did all of that.
Persuader: This morning, I was also reading about an ebola outbreak in the Congo (I think).
Persuader: I imagine they'll help there if they aren't stretched too thin.
Persuadee: So save the children is a worldwide organization it sounds like!
Persuader: It is!
Persuader: Do you ever donate to organizations like this?
Persuader: My brother, sister, and I replaced birthday gifts with charity donations a few years ago.

Persuader: I remember reading about some questionable charities following hurricanes in Haiti and Puerto Rico.

Conversation:
Persuader: Did you Know that Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: I think I've heard of them, but aren't they religiously affiliated?
Persuadee: I'm all for improving conditions for children in developing countries, but I don't really want money paying for evangelizing.
Persuader: Yes they are affiliated with religion but all proceeds are put towards saving the children they do profit are use any funds for personal gain or spread of religion.
Persuadee: How transparent are they about uses of their funds?
Persuadee: Are they well rated by the watchdog groups that keep an eye on non-profits?

Persuader: Not many kids get a real shot and they all deserve one If I had a chance to change a childs life foe the better and didn't I would not be able to live with myself.

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello!
Persuader: How are you tonight?
Persuadee: Hey, I am fine!!
Persuadee: How are you
Persuader: How are you
Persuader: I am good.
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the children?
Persuadee: It sounds familiar.
Persuadee: I think I have heard of it.
Persuader: I think I have heard of it.
Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: Yeah, I just looked it up.
Persuadee: :)  I like that it's non-governmental.
Persuader: Yes I love that too.
Persuader: It ensures childrens right to health, education and so on.
Persuader: Do you ever volunteer or make donations?
Persuadee: I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past.
Persuadee: Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years.
Persuadee: It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.
Persuader: You are an amazing person for caring for these  babies.
Persuader: Animals are like children.
Persuader: In the first 2 months of 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured.
Persuader: Save the Children is an amazing organization.
Persuadee: How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.
Persuadee: If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?
Persuader: The children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuader: Syrian children have grown up facing daily threat of violence.
Persuadee: I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago.
Persuadee: It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures.
Persuadee: It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.
Persuadee: Their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.
Persuader: It is so sad that children have to been in the middle of all the hate in the world today.
Persuader: It breaks my heart to see and hear of how bad children have to live and what they go thru each and every single day.
Persuadee: Me too.
Persuadee: I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive.
Persuader: Making a small donation today will indeed help children and their families in such sad situations.
Persuader: Would you be willing to donate from your task payment today?
Persuadee: Absolutely.
Persuadee: I hope everyone does.
Persuader: I most definitely agree.
Persuader: How much will you be donating today?
Persuadee: Whatever my task payment will be. , [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly exchange of greetings and well-being inquiries. As the dialogue progresses, the focus shifts to discussing charitable organizations, specifically Save the Children. The speakers express mutual admiration for the organization's mission. The conversation becomes more personal as EE shares past donation experiences and a story about animal rescue, which ER praises. ER then steers the conversation back to the plight of children in conflict zones, evoking empathy from EE. The dialogue concludes with ER encouraging a donation, to which EE readily agrees, demonstrating a shared commitment to the cause.]<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello!
Persuadee: hi
Persuader: Have you heard of the charity, Save the Children?
Persuadee: no I have not...what is it about?
Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuader: You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to.
Persuader: URL
Persuadee: ooo ok...thats good that there is a organization put together to help children in other countries
Persuader: Yes, it is good.
Persuader: But they are really under funded.
Persuader: Would you be willing to donate to the charity now?
Persuadee: I will have to read up more about the organization before i just give my money up because there is fake charities in the world
Persuader: I understand that.
Persuader: Your donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuader: Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.
Persuadee: Yes i understand that because every sunday i would go to the homeless shelter in my town and help collect clothes for the people that need it.it is something i do once a week because it is the right thing to do..
Persuader: It is the right thing to do.
Persuader: That helps people directly in your community.
Persuader: A lot of these children don't have people like you in their community.
Persuader: There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.
Persuader: For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuader: Your small donation can address such problems.
Persuadee: Yes i have read about that and that is said for those children...where are you from?
Persuader: I'm in the United States.
Persuader: I live in Indiana.
Persuadee: cool i never been how is it??
Persuadee: I live in new york
Persuader: The weather is totally hit or miss.
Persuader: Right now it's in the 90's and sooo humid!
Persuader: Indiana is so flat and really all looks the same.
Persuader: We have a lot of farmers here.
Persuader: So it's true, there is a lot of corn in Indiana. lol
Persuader: How much would you like to donate to the charity now?
Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.
Persuader: You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
Persuadee: at the moment i would have to say 0 because i don't know to much about the charity...sorry
Persuader: Bummer, even 5 cents of your pay out helps!!! , [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly exchange and an introduction to a charity, with ER providing information and encouraging EE to consider donating. EE expresses interest but also hesitance, citing a need for more information due to concerns about fraudulent charities. ER acknowledges this and continues to emphasize the impact of donations, using emotional appeals. The conversation shifts briefly to a personal exchange about locations and weather, before ER returns to the donation request. EE remains cautious, ultimately declining to donate.]<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello, I would like to talk to you about making a donation to Save the Children
Persuadee: Okay, if you don
Persuader: Your donation will help to ensure children's rights to healthcare, education, safety, etc
Persuadee: Does this money that goes for donation stay here in the United States?
Persuader: No, not all of it will stay in the United states
Persuadee: Is there a specific age or race of children that Save the Children are looking to benefit?
Persuader: No, they don't have any prejudice like that, it's strictly to help children in general who are in need
Persuadee: This allows doctors to go to other countries?
Persuadee: I am trying to understand how it is decided what child in need gets the help.

Persuader: hi there!
Persuadee: Hello.
Persuadee: How you doin
Persuader: pretty good.
Persuader: It looks like this chat is supposed to be to learn more about ""Save the Children"".
Persuader: Have you ever heard of it?
Persuadee: Yes I am aware of that charity
Persuader: It seems vaguely familiar but I never paid attention specifically.
Persuader: Have you ever donated to them?
Persuadee: I have not but I have to some others recently
Persuader: Do you feel that Save the Children is a good charity to give to?
Persuader: From what I'm reading, it sounds like a great cause
Persuadee: I know a little can you maybe provide some info for me?
Persuader: It seems to be international, and supports children in developing countries.
Persuader: It's apparently very influential in war zones like Syria
Persuadee: Oh wow that is good to know.
Persuadee: I know Syria is a mess recently
Persuader: Absolutely.
Persuader: It says on their site that in the first two months of this year alone, 1000 children were killed or injured there
Persuadee: Ugh that is rough..  Nobody deserves that in this world
Persuader: I can't imagine what that's like for the parents.
Persuader: As a mom myself, I'm thinking about donating my earnings from this task to them
Persuadee: That sounds like a good idea so what amount is the max i can donate?
Persuader: From what I can tell, we can donate anywhere from 0 to $2 (the full payment).
Persuader: Then through the official Save the Children website, I'm sure there's no max (and there'd be a tax deduction)
Persuadee: Ok good to know.
Persuadee: Thank you very much forthat info you have been very helpful! , [Summary: The conversation begins with a casual greeting and quickly shifts to a discussion about the charity ""Save the Children.""

Persuader: Hi there.
Persuader: How are you today?
Persuadee: Hello, I am fine, how about you?
Persuader: Very well thanks.
Persuader: Do you currently give any money to charity on a regular basis?
Persuadee: Yes, I try to help time to time
Persuader: Any charity in particular?
Persuadee: No, anything that catches my eyes, or I find them on gofundme, what about you?
Persuader: I have a few payments set up monthly.
Persuader: I assume then you've heard of Save the Children and the great work they do with young people?
Persuadee: Yes, I've heard of it.
Persuadee: Can you please explain more about it?
Persuader: Firstly, they provide funds and support services to help protect vulnerable children all over the world.
Persuader: Once the children have a safe environment the next priority is to improve their lives via education and other resources.
Persuader: They really make a difference to the lives of children in poverty or destitution.
Persuadee: I am interested in it.
Persuadee: I already checked their website.
Persuadee: Health and education both are important factors
Persuader: Absolutely.
Persuader: And the great thing for us is that even a very small donation goes a long way due to the number of people who can donate!
Persuader: We're asking people today to give a small part of the payment for this HIT to the charity.
Persuader: You'll get a box pop up at teh end of our chat which will give you the opportunity to donate something.

Persuader: Have you thought about how much of the reward for this HIT you want to donate to Save the Children?
Persuadee: I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.
Persuadee: I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.
Persuader: Save the Children is a great international no-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuader: It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children.
Persuadee: I know that it is a good organization and I support them.
Persuadee: However I am not getting a reward from this hit.
Persuadee: I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.
Persuadee: I want the money to do with as I choose.
Persuader: Save the Children has helped build hundreds of schools in developing nations around the world.
Persuader: They've educated many children who have gone on to do important medical and other life saving jobs.
Persuadee: I still do not want to make a donation from this money.
Persuader: Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year!
Persuader: Save the Children is helping to evacuate as many children as possible from that country.
Persuader: Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life?
Persuadee: Yes I do think that they do.
Persuader: Don't you want to be part of the solution by giving as much money as possible to Save the Children so they can help as many children as possible?

Persuader: Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money.
Persuadee: I am not going to waste the reward.
Persuadee: I use it for things that my family needs.
Persuader: Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money.

Persuader: Of course you work for everything you own.
Persuader: By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood. , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER suggesting a donation, but EE firmly declines, explaining a preference for personal use of earnings. ER persists with persuasive strategies, highlighting the charity's impact and moral appeals.

Conversation:
Persuader: Have you thought about how much of the reward for this HIT you want to donate to Save the Children?
Persuadee: I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.
Persuadee: I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.
Persuader: Save the Children is a great international no-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuader: It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children.
Persuadee: I know that it is a good organization and I support them.
Persuadee: However I am not getting a reward from this hit.
Persuadee: I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.
Persuadee: I want the money to do with as I choose.
Persuader: Save the Children has helped build hundreds of schools in developing nations around the world.
Persuader: They've educated many children who have gone on to do important medical and other life saving jobs.
Persuadee: I still do not want to make a donation from this money.
Persuader: Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year!
Persuader: Save the Children is helping to evacuate as many children as possible from that country.
Persuader: Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life?
Persuadee: Yes I do think that they do.
Persuader: Don't you want to be part of the solution by giving as much money as possible to Save the Children so they can help as many children as possible?
Persuadee: I do not want to make a donation today.
Persuader: Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money.

Persuadee: Hi.
Persuadee: I really do not know much about children's charity, do you?

Persuader: It's called Save the Children.
Persuader: Have you heard of it?

Persuadee: Does it have commercials on tv?
Persuader: Yes, they do.

Persuader: They help out children in the US and around the world.
Persuader: You should check out their website:  URL s/what-we-do/us-programs

Persuadee: I ask that because volunteering would be easier for me than sending money.

Persuader: I would love to do that but can't possibly get that much time off.

Persuader: Good afternoon/evening
Persuadee: Hello
Persuader: Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?
Persuadee: Nope, what do you recommend?
Persuader: I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.
Persuader: I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.
Persuader: Even small amounts will definitely help
Persuadee: What's Save the Children all about?
Persuader: They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.
Persuader: They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate
Persuadee: Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?
Persuader: They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home
Persuadee: Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too
Persuader: That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.
Persuader: People far away need help just as much as people close to us.
Persuader: You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies

Persuader: Hey there :) How are you feeling today?

Persuader: Not too bad, all things considered
Persuadee: Thats good to hear.
Persuadee: Where are you from?
Persuader: U.S. How about you?
Persuader: Think they matched us with our complete opposites? :P
Persuadee: Same.
Persuadee: Maybe, I'm not sure.

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello, have you heard of Save The Children?
Persuadee: I think so, it sounds familiar.
Persuadee: it is a nonprofit charity if i recall.
Persuadee: What exactly do they do?
Persuader: Save The Children helps kids from around the world by taking contributions from generous patrons. Kids from countries that have been stricken by poverty, violence, and other blights.
Persuadee: What countries has the charity worked in recently?
Persuader: Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now.
Persuader: Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.
Persuadee: Wow that sounds like a really robust program.
Persuadee: How long has Save the Children been around?
Persuader: It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK.
Persuadee: Do you work for Save the Children or do you just volunteer for the charity?
Persuader: I do not work for them, I work on behalf of them.
Persuader: That is why I'm talking to you today.
Persuader: These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you.
Persuader: A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want.
Persuader: Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars.
Persuader: For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.
Persuadee: I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question.
Persuadee: What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses
Persuader: Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.
Persuadee: That's pretty impressive!
Persuadee: Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.
Persuader: We do it for them, not for ourselves.
Persuader: And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do.
Persuadee: I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.

Persuader: Would you like to know about a potential child this money would be helping?
Persuadee: Sure, tell me more about a potential child this money would help.
Persuader: Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher.
Persuader: It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old. , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER introducing Save The Children and providing information about its mission and recent activities. EE shows interest and asks questions to understand the organization's work better. ER employs a persuasive strategy by sharing specific details and statistics about the charity's impact and efficiency.

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello.
Persuader: Would you like to donate a portion of your reward to a charity called Save the Children?
Persuadee: I think I would be willing to donate a portion.
Persuader: Excellent!
Persuader: Would you like to know more about the charity first?
Persuadee: Yes, that was going to be my next question.
Persuader: Save the Children promotes children's rights, and helps children from developing countries.
Persuadee: What types of children's rights?
Persuader: Your donation would help ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.
Persuader: Many of these children live in developing or war-torn areas where these basic necessities are hard to come by.
Persuadee: What type of people or who manages this fund?
Persuader: Save the Children has excellent credentials and is managed by a board of commercial CEOs and business leaders without any government or religious affiliation.
Persuadee: Does Save the Children help children in the United States?
Persuader: Yes!
Persuader: Since 1932, Save the Children has been on the ground providing support to the most isolated and underserved children in rural America.
Persuader: Many of these children don't have the same opportunities as others and live in very difficult conditions.
Persuadee: That is awesome.
Persuadee: I work hard to help children as well.
Persuader: That's great!
Persuader: It is a worthwhile cause and every penny has a significant impact on these children's lives.
Persuader: Even a small donation can have a large impact in impoverished areas.
Persuadee: I am curious why you chose the words ""rural America""?
Persuader: Of course.
Persuader: I chose those words because across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty and, of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural.
Persuader: Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential.
Persuadee: mmmm that is interesting, I did not know that statistic.
Persuadee: I work with children more in an ""urban"" setting that are incredibly in bad circumstances.
Persuader: I agree that children in both settings need help and commend you for your efforts. , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER introducing the idea of donating to a charity, which EE is open to considering.

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello.
Persuader: Would you like to donate a portion of your reward to a charity called Save the Children?
Persuadee: I think I would be willing to donate a portion.
Persuader: Excellent!
Persuader: Would you like to know more about the charity first?
Persuadee: Yes, that was going to be my next question.
Persuader: Save the Children promotes children's rights, and helps children from developing countries.
Persuadee: What types of children's rights?
Persuader: Your donation would help ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.
Persuader: Many of these children live in developing or war-torn areas where these basic necessities are hard to come by.
Persuadee: What type of people or who manages this fund?
Persuader: Save the Children has excellent credentials and is managed by a board of commercial CEOs and business leaders without any government or religious affiliation.
Persuadee: Does Save the Children help children in the United States?
Persuader: Yes!
Persuader: Since 1932, Save the Children has been on the ground providing support to the most isolated and underserved children in rural America.
Persuader: Many of these children don't have the same opportunities as others and live in very difficult conditions.
Persuadee: That is awesome.
Persuadee: I work hard to help children as well.
Persuader: That's great!
Persuader: It is a worthwhile cause and every penny has a significant impact on these children's lives.
Persuader: Even a small donation can have a large impact in impoverished areas.
Persuadee: I am curious why you chose the words ""rural America""?
Persuader: Of course.
Persuader: I chose those words because across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty and, of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural.
Persuader: Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential.
Persuadee: mmmm that is interesting, I did not know that statistic.
Persuadee: I work with children more in an ""urban"" setting that are incredibly in bad circumstances.
Persuader: I agree that children in both settings need help and commend you for your efforts., [Summary: The conversation begins with ER introducing the idea of donating to a charity, which EE is open to considering.
