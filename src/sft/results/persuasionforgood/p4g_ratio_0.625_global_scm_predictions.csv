Persuadee: I think it's a scam
Persuader: Oh no not at all they do tons of good  is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: I don't believe it.
Persuadee: There is no way to prove where all those funds go.
Persuadee: Plus there are starving children right here in america
Persuader: This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.
Persuader: They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: That is all your opinion.
Persuadee: You have no facts to back that up.
Persuader: Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.
Persuader: This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities

Persuader: Right now save the children has a partnership that will double any donation made so any little bit would help
Persuadee: I would not be willing to donate, because I have never seen any impact made by their organization.

Persuader: how can we sit here and do nothing?
Persuadee: Do nothing about what?
Persuader: These poor suffering children!

Persuader: Around the world!
Persuader: There is so much that could be done..
Persuader: between preventing the spread of aids, reducing the infant mortality rate with proper education and vaccinations, and ensuring access and aid to proper nutrition so many children could be saved.

Persuader: It is disturbing!
Persuader: And yes, it could seem like the aid is a drop in a bucket.
Persuader: However, if we can move the scale one iota and can consider that what that represents is one child having a week of meals or a healthy 3 months than wouldn't you agree that that would be worth any aid that we could provide?

Persuader: Hello!
Persuadee: Hello
Persuader: So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children.
Persuader: Have you heard of that charity before?
Persuadee: Know I have not.
Persuadee: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries.
Persuader: It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: What is the organization called?
Persuader: It's called Save the Children.
Persuader: It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat.
Persuader: It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat.
Persuader: Do you donate much to charity now?
Persuadee: O I have heard of Save the children.
Persuadee: I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.
Persuadee: Currently I do not donate to charities.
Persuadee: I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.
Persuadee: I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.
Persuader: I understand.
Persuader: I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend.
Persuader: I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday.
Persuader: However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out.
Persuader: It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.
Persuadee: I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.
Persuadee: I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.
Persuader: I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding.
Persuader: If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?
Persuader: Yes, I believe so.
Persuader: Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task
Persuadee: Okay that is nice and simple.
Persuader: Absolutely!

Persuadee: It's great to earn extra money here and there.
Persuadee: I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Persuader: Well thanks, Cassidy.
Persuader: It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.
Persuader: I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.
Persuader: For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.
Persuader: And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.
Persuader: How about you, Cassidy?
Persuader: Do you like giving to charities?
Persuadee: I do enjoy donating to charities.
Persuadee: I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year.
Persuadee: And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university
Persuader: Aww, that's really considerate of you.
Persuader: I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.
Persuader: Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.
Persuader: I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.
Persuader: It's really sweet.
Persuader: Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children?
Persuadee: No, I haven't heard of Save the Children.
Persuadee: And its awesome that you help out those kids in need
Persuader: The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know?
Persuader: I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites.
Persuader: The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.
Persuader: It's really really sad what's going on over there.
Persuader: Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?
Persuadee: Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad.
Persuadee: Maybe I'll consider donating to them
