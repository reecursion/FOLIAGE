Persuader: Hello how do you feel about the Save the Children charity?
Persuadee: I think it's a scam
Persuader: Oh no not at all they do tons of good  is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: I don't believe it.
Persuadee: There is no way to prove where all those funds go.
Persuadee: Plus there are starving children right here in america
Persuader: This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.
Persuader: They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: That is all your opinion.
Persuadee: You have no facts to back that up.
Persuader: Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.
Persuader: This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities
Persuadee: Like I said those are opinions.
Persuadee: There are no facts that prove that to be true.
Persuadee: There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.
Persuadee: I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization.
Persuadee: Infomercials don't impress me.

Persuadee: Have you ever heard of evangelism?
Persuadee: Again, you're only giving me an opinion.
Persuadee: I just can't see any good being done.

Persuader: Just because it is not happening somewhere that you see everyday does not mean that it does not exsist.
Persuader: They actually fund the head start that my child will be going to till fall.

Persuader: Have you heard of the Save the Children non profit organization?
Persuadee: Hello, yes I have but I am not sure what the charity works towards
Persuader: It is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: Ah ok very nice.
Persuadee: It sounds like a good charity.
Persuadee: Are you thinking of donating to it?
Persuader: I am thinking about it.
Persuader: I was hoping you would think about it too.
Persuader: It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuader: This makes me angry and was wondering if it did the same for you?
Persuadee: Yes, I definitely understand you.
Persuadee: It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country
Persuader: I know it is crazy.

Persuader: Have you heard of that charity before?
Persuadee: Know I have not.
Persuadee: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries.
Persuader: It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: What is the organization called?
Persuader: It's called Save the Children.
Persuader: It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat.
Persuader: It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat.
Persuader: Do you donate much to charity now?
Persuadee: O I have heard of Save the children.
Persuadee: I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.
Persuadee: Currently I do not donate to charities.
Persuadee: I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.
Persuadee: I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.
Persuader: I understand.
Persuader: I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend.
Persuader: I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday.
Persuader: However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out.
Persuader: It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.
Persuadee: I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.
Persuadee: I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.
Persuader: I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding.
Persuader: If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation

Persuadee: Hello, I'm fine.
Persuadee: How are you?
Persuader: I'm doing well. Thanks.
Persuader: Have you been using MTurk long?
Persuader: I've only just started in the last few days and I love it.
Persuader: It's pretty easy money most of the time.
Persuader: I'm Tommy, by the way.
Persuadee: Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy.
Persuadee: I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday.
Persuadee: It's great to earn extra money here and there.
Persuadee: I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Persuader: Well thanks, Cassidy.
Persuader: It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.
Persuader: I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.
Persuader: For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.
Persuader: And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.
Persuader: How about you, Cassidy?
Persuader: Do you like giving to charities?
Persuadee: I do enjoy donating to charities.
Persuadee: I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year.
Persuadee: And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university
Persuader: Aww, that's really considerate of you.
Persuader: I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.
Persuader: Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.
Persuader: I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.
Persuader: It's really sweet.
Persuader: Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello.
Persuadee: Hello!
Persuader: I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people.
Persuader: Is that okay?
Persuader: To talk about suffering people and children for a minute?
Persuadee: I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.
Persuader: I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.
Persuader: If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.
Persuadee: I feel really torn about the crisis.
Persuadee: I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.
Persuadee: At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.
Persuader: I actually didn't think of it like that.
Persuader: I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.
Persuader: This whole chat thing is supposed to get me to get you to donate to Save the Children, but now I think they got me to do it instead!
Persuader: I don't know if that's really okay to do though.
Persuadee: I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.
Persuadee: I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call ""stupid"".
Persuadee: I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.
Persuadee: Sorry Im getting off topic.
Persuader: No, that's relevant.
Persuader: Really relevant.
Persuader: It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.
Persuader: I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.
Persuader: If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.
Persuader: The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.
Persuader: You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.
Persuadee: With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Prediction: DONATION: NO

Reasoning: The persuadee is hesitant and unsure about donating a large amount of money, stating they don't have much and are working part-time while attending college. They initially thought the conversation was hypothetical and only agree to donate $100 after the persuadeer suggests it. The persuadeer is homeless and appears to be using the conversation for charity, but they only plan on donating $10. This conversation does not suggest a strong inclination for the persuadee to donate on the spot.<|eot_id|>",True,NO,False

To predict whether the persuadee will make a donation on the spot at the end of this conversation, let's analyze the conversation:

1. The persuadee is not familiar with the charity, which may indicate a lack of emotional connection.
2. The persuadee has not made a donation recently, which suggests a lack of commitment to donating.
3. The persuadee's response to the charity is neutral (""That sounds like a decent organization""), which does not indicate strong enthusiasm or interest.
4. The persuadee is not actively engaged in the conversation, instead providing short and neutral responses.

Based on these observations, it is unlikely that the persuadee will make a donation on the spot at the end of this conversation.

Persuadee: Please tell me more.
Persuader: These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need.

Persuader has provided some information about the charity, but it seems that it's not enough to convince the persuadee. The persuadee still has concerns about donating to an unknown charity. Persuader's last message does not seem to be persuasive. Persuader's statement ""I don't like children but perhaps you do"" seems to be a weak attempt to appeal to the persuadee's emotions. The persuadee's last message suggests that they are not willing to donate at this point. Therefore, the persuadee is unlikely to make a donation on the spot.

Persuader: Of course you can donate to other charities.
Persuader: It's not necessarily a zero-sum game.
Persuader: I can tell you, however, that Save the Children is, in a way, more immediate in helping people (as opposed to fighting disease like St Jude's) and delivers services similar to the Red Cross, but directed toward children.
Persuader: So, please: think of the children!
Persuadee: Do they help kids in the US?
Persuadee: I like to help people that are close to home.
Persuader: Their assistance is directed toward children in developing countries, where, unlike most of the US, children are totally deprived of opportunity and basic services.<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
