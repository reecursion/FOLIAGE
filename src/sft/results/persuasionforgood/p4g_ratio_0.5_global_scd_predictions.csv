Persuader: Oh no not at all they do tons of good  is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: I don't believe it.
Persuadee: There is no way to prove where all those funds go.
Persuadee: Plus there are starving children right here in america
Persuader: This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.
Persuader: They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: That is all your opinion.
Persuadee: You have no facts to back that up.
Persuader: Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.
Persuader: This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities
Persuadee: Like I said those are opinions.
Persuadee: There are no facts that prove that to be true.
Persuadee: There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.

EE, on the other hand, is resistant to ER's arguments, relying on skepticism and a lack of personal experience to inform their position. ER's use of facts and personal anecdotes is met with EE's skepticism, highlighting the challenges of persuasion in the face of entrenched beliefs. The conversation raises questions about the effectiveness of persuasion in changing someone's mind and the importance of considering multiple perspectives when evaluating complex issues. Predicted outcome: DONATION: NO. EE's skepticism and lack of trust in ER's claims make it unlikely that EE will make a donation on the spot.]<|eot_id|>",False,NO,True

EE, on the other hand, maintains a cautious approach, inquiring about the charity's scope and values before considering a donation. Throughout the conversation, ER skillfully navigates EE's concerns, adapting the conversation to align with EE's interests and preferences. The conversation is a delicate dance of persuasion, with ER seeking to balance the exchange to secure a donation while EE remains open to the possibility of supporting the charity. Predicting the outcome of this conversation requires analyzing EE's responses and ER's persuasive strategies. EE's initial interest and openness suggest a willingness to consider supporting the charity, but EE's preference for religious-based organizations and cautious questioning indicate a need for further information before committing to a donation. ER's persuasive approach and alignment with EE's values may sway EE's decision, but EE's final response remains uncertain. Considering these factors, the prediction for this conversation is: DONATION: YES.<|eot_id|>",False,NO,True

Persuader: It's called Save the Children.

Conversation:
Persuader: Hello.
Persuadee: Hello!
Persuader: I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people.
Persuader: Is that okay?
Persuader: To talk about suffering people and children for a minute?
Persuadee: I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.
Persuader: I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.
Persuader: If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.
Persuadee: I feel really torn about the crisis.
Persuadee: I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.
Persuadee: At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.
Persuader: I actually didn't think of it like that.
Persuader: I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.
Persuader: This whole chat thing is supposed to get me to get you to donate to Save the Children, but now I think they got me to do it instead!
Persuader: I don't know if that's really okay to do though.
Persuadee: I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.
Persuadee: I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call ""stupid"".
Persuadee: I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.
Persuadee: Sorry Im getting off topic.
Persuader: No, that's relevant.
Persuader: Really relevant.
Persuader: It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.
Persuader: I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.
Persuader: If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.
Persuader: The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.
Persuader: You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.
Persuadee: With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most. , [Summary: The conversation begins with ER cautiously introducing a sensitive topic, showing concern for EE's comfort. EE responds openly, allowing the discussion to delve into personal reflections on the refugee crisis. Both speakers share parental perspectives, leading to a shift in ER's stance, who initially aimed to persuade EE to donate but finds themselves reconsidering their own views. EE expresses skepticism about donations, which ER acknowledges, fostering a shared understanding of the complexities and emotional weight of charitable giving.]<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Persuader: I am doing great!
Persuader: I am here to let you know about this amazing international foundation called Save the Children that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support them in developing countries.
Persuadee: Please tell me more.
Persuader: These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need.
