Conversation:
Persuader: Hello, I would like to ask you to consider making a donation to Save the Children, an international NGO committed to promoting children's rights, and providing support for children in developing countries.
Persuadee: ohh how much donation would yoy expect?
Persuader: Your donation can be from $0 to all of the payment for this task.
Persuader: But before you decide hastily, I would like to remind you that Save the Children is one of the only charities doing what it does.
Persuader: There are children out there now without access to housing, clean water, education, and many other things we often take for granted.
Persuader: So please, consider thoughtfully whether you would be willing to make a sacrifice for the children of the world.
Persuadee: how do i trust the organiation?
Persuader: Save the Children is a world-renowned NGO with a trusted history and background.
Persuader: You can read about their successes on their website:   URL
Persuader: Also, they have been given high ratings from different charity watchodgs.
Persuadee: okay i will check it.. by the way how much did you donate?
Persuader: I donated $2, which is the maximum payment.
Persuader: I understand that everyone cannot commit to making a serious donation, but when we think about children suffering, we have a moral imperative to act in their defense.
Persuadee: okay i will donate $1
Persuader: If it's not too much to ask, I would like you to consider donating perhaps more.
Persuader: After all, there are children in Syria now growing up facing threats of violence everyday.
Persuader: Surely an additional dollar, which we might spend on a cup of coffee or a bag of chips, could more greatly aid them then us.
Persuadee: no i am okay with this amount
Persuader: OK, I will not force you to make a decision you don't want to.
Persuader: I will just ask you to consider how you would feel if your child was danger like many children are.
Persuadee: actually i am not donating like this.. if i would like to donate money i will give food and clothes to the kids directly
Persuader: While that is possible in a local community, it fails to take into account the suffering of kids in developing countries around the world, a specialty of Save the Children.
