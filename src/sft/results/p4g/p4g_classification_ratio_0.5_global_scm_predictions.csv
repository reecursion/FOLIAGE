Persuadee: Plus there are starving children right here in america
Persuader: This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.
Persuader: They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: That is all your opinion.
Persuadee: You have no facts to back that up.
Persuader: Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.
Persuader: This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities

Persuader: Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.

Persuadee: Children should be our top priority all across the world.
Persuadee: How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?
Persuader: Oh there are quiet a few ways.
Persuader: For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.
Persuader: With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.
Persuader: Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.
Persuadee: I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.

Persuadee: Hello
Persuader: So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children.
Persuader: Have you heard of that charity before?
Persuadee: Know I have not.
Persuadee: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries.
Persuader: It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: What is the organization called?
Persuader: It's called Save the Children.
Persuader: It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat.
Persuader: It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat.
Persuader: Do you donate much to charity now?
Persuadee: O I have heard of Save the children.
Persuadee: I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.
Persuadee: Currently I do not donate to charities.
Persuadee: I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.
Persuadee: I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.
Persuader: I understand.
Persuader: I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend.
Persuader: I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday.
Persuader: However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out.
Persuader: It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.
Persuadee: I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.
Persuadee: I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.
Persuader: I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding.
Persuader: If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation
Persuadee: Okay.

Persuader: Hello, have you heard of Save The Children?
Persuadee: I think so, it sounds familiar.
Persuadee: it is a nonprofit charity if i recall.
Persuadee: What exactly do they do?
Persuader: Save The Children helps kids from around the world by taking contributions from generous patrons. Kids from countries that have been stricken by poverty, violence, and other blights.
Persuadee: What countries has the charity worked in recently?
Persuader: Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now.
Persuader: Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.
Persuadee: Wow that sounds like a really robust program.
Persuadee: How long has Save the Children been around?
Persuader: It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK.
Persuadee: Do you work for Save the Children or do you just volunteer for the charity?
Persuader: I do not work for them, I work on behalf of them.
Persuader: That is why I'm talking to you today.
Persuader: These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you.
Persuader: A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want.
Persuader: Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars.
Persuader: For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.
Persuadee: I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question.
Persuadee: What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses
Persuader: Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.
