Persuader (ER): Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now.
Persuader (ER): Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries.

Persuader (ER): Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.
Persuadee (EE): That's pretty impressive!
Persuadee (EE): Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.

Persuadee (EE): Unfortunately some ""charities"" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.

Persuadee (EE): That way nobody can question anything.
Persuader (ER): Oh yeah.
Persuader (ER): When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.
