Seller: Very well do you have any questions about the bike 150 is a very fair price! [Prompt for questions and assert price fairness]
Buyer: The bike is indeed good one...I just wanted to check about the wear and tear...on scale of 1-5 (5 being brand new), how would you rate it? [Compliment the bike and inquire about its condition]
Seller: I would give it a solid 4 my son did learn to ride on it so there is SOME evidence of use but very little. [Provide condition rating and minor usage details]
Buyer: Thats great...and how old is the bike in months? [Inquire about the bike's age]
Seller: 14 months old [Provide the bike's age]

Seller: Ah that is not a problem at all the tires were replaced 3 months ago! [Reassure about tire condition and recent replacement]
Buyer: You had to change the tyres within a year for a brand new bike? Anyways its good to know....would you consider $65 for it? I can pick it up...it may sound way less...but I saw few more in that band [Express skepticism about tire replacement and make a low offer]
Seller: No that is less than my asking price and a very unfair price for a bike of this quality i would consider 110 and i can drop it off whenever you like.

Seller: Understood. I'm asking $9,000 for it at the moment. We could definitely arrange for a test drive, but I don't think I can be that flexible on the price. [Price Statement and Conditional Agreement to Test Drive]
Buyer: Hmm, well I think the asking price is too steep considering the year and the car having 117k miles on it. I just bought a 2011 VW GTI with 56k on it for 9,000. I think I can go up to around $6,500 for this BWM. Anything more is too much in my opinion. [Counter-Offer with Justification]
Seller: So while it's a 2006 model, it is a rather large BMW sports utility vehicle.  Luxury SUVs hold their value well and BMW doesn't change their styling much from year to year. I could go $8,000. [Justification of Price and Counter-Offer]
