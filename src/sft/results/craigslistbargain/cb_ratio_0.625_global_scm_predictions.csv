Seller: Yes we have a community pool for the tenants, it's right in the center of the building, where most places have a courtyard. There is also a small gym near the laundry room.
Buyer: Oh wow nice!  Being a single mom and all the rent is just a little high for me, is it negotiable at all?
Seller: Let's see what we can do. Where are you coming from? Has your daughter been enrolled in school yet?
Buyer: Yes we already live in the area, that's why I'd like to keep her in the same district and the location of the apartments is perfect. I could afford $1978 for rent if that is possible. I'd be willing to take a smaller unit.
Seller: I'm sorry but I'll have to insist that you stay in a two bedroom. Those are the rules with children. It's very important to use all of the rooms as intended here at Cinnamon Apartments. However, you mentioned the pool earlier. Do you enjoy swimming?], [Summary: user1 (Buyer):

INPUT: <$450, $750, [Seller: Hi! I am willing to sell this bike at a great price are you interested?
Buyer: Yes, I am very interested! It looks like a beautiful bike.
Seller: Ok cool! The bike has very low miles and has and upgraded WTB saddle! It also has carbon blade forks and 105 brakes. I am willing to sell for as low as $750.
Buyer: $750 seems a little steep since the bike already has some miles on it. Would you accept $400?
Seller: $595 is the lowest for a fact!
Buyer: $595 is a little high for my budget. Are there any accessories you'd be willing to throw in--for instance, a basket, lights, and/or bike pump? That would make it a lot more appealing for me.
Seller: I will throw in my 700c wheelset, instead of the standard wheelset. How about that!
