Seller: I can't offer to pay your utilities because there's no telling what that cost will be.  However, the home could easily be equipped with solar panels.

Seller: Would you be willing to split the difference at 22 per chair?
Buyer: I was hoping to pay less because I don't have a truck so I will need to pay a friend to pick them up.

Seller: Understood. I'm asking $9,000 for it at the moment. We could definitely arrange for a test drive, but I don't think I can be that flexible on the price.
