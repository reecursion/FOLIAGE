Seller: I can't offer to pay your utilities because there's no telling what that cost will be.  However, the home could easily be equipped with solar panels.

INPUT: <$200, $400, [Seller: Hello, are you interested in my phone?
Buyer: Yes. Could you tell me why you are getting rid of it
Seller: I switched to AT&T and can't use the phone since it is for Verizon.
Buyer: Makes sense. So there is nothing actually wrong with the phone itself that I should know about?
Seller: No, absolutely nothing. It is in brand new condition. Even in the box with all the packaging, including the headphones and screen protector and everything. Never used.
Buyer: Wow. As good as a deal this seems I need to work on getting the price closer to $200
Seller: Well I can't go anywhere that low, considering it's worth more than 400 as it is. I could maybe take 20$ and do 380.
Buyer: I just can't afford that at this time. I could possibly get $300 if I cash in some coins but I don't have anything more than that.], [Summary: The conversation begins with the seller's straightforward inquiry about the buyer's interest, followed by the buyer's cautious probing about the phone's condition.

INPUT: <$900, $1500, [Seller: Hello, are you looking to rent out my inlaw?
Buyer: Yes. Would $900.00 be agreeable?
Seller: No, I'm afraid $900 would be far too low. This is in a very desirable area of Oakland, and it even comes with a shared on site laundry.
Buyer: Then, how about $1,000.00? I'm on a very strict budget, but I need something right away. I'm very quiet, I always pay on time and I have no pets.
Seller: That's closer, but I still think $1400 would be a more fair price. I forgot to mention another great benefit of this rental. Your private entry leads to the apartment above the garage, and the garage gets used every night for some local teens to practice their rock music, so it's like you get a free concert every night :)
Buyer: That wouldn't be good for me because I'm not a rock fan. But it does look very pleasant and it's close to where I work so I'll offer $1100.
Buyer: If you don't mind if I play my collection of barbershop quartet cds rather loudly, so as to help drown out the rock music, I'll consider $1200.], [Summary: The conversation begins with the buyer making a low initial offer, which the seller rejects, emphasizing the property's desirable features. The buyer then increases their offer slightly, citing budget constraints and personal qualities. The seller counters with a higher price, adding more details about the property's unique aspects. The buyer responds with a higher offer, expressing concerns about noise and humorously suggesting a compromise involving their own music preferences, indicating a willingness to negotiate further.]><|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Buyer: It seems pretty ideal, but I am on a budget, and I have my eye on a few other places. I'm looking to spend closer to $1600, but I'm willing to negotiate on the price.
Seller: It's Fremont.  You can barely get yourself an apartment for $1600 that is centrally located like this.  At the asking price, it's quite a steal.
Buyer: I'm sure it is. Money is tight for me, that's all. Will you accept $1920?
Seller: What I can do, is lower the asking price a bit and ask for 1/2 the deposit.  How does $2700 sound with only $1000 deposit.  We can also change it to month-to-month agreement, so you can leave anytime you want.  How does that sound?
Buyer: I can do $2080 and the regular $2000 deposit price.], [Summary: The conversation begins with the buyer expressing interest in the rental property but indicating budget constraints.

INPUT: <$836, $1100, [Buyer: Hi!  I am interested in your bike.  How long have you had it?
Seller: I'm glad you're interested. We've only had it for about 6 months. It only has about 50 miles on it!
Buyer: That's definitely a plus!  My wife is an avid biker and I want to surprise her with a nice bike.  Something like this would normally be way out of my price range.  But, I figured I would give it a try.
Seller: Well my wife has definitely enjoyed it, so if yours is like mine I'm sure she will too! I've listed this at $1100 and I expect it to go quickly.
Buyer: I won't argue that it is a decent price.  Just wondering, is there anything wrong with it?  Seems like a lot to spend on a bike that only has 50 miles of usage...
