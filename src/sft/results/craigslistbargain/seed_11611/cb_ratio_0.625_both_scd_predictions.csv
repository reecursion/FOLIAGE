And it does not have a washer/dryer inside the unit?  Is it shared with the other people in the complex? [Express surprise and ask for additional details about amenities], Seller: Yes they are shared.  I am willing to lower the price a little, make me an offer [Confirm shared amenities and invite an offer], Buyer: Okay, will you take $900? 100 square feet is just much smaller than I anticipated but I guess I could squeeze my bed in there if you'll drop the price a bit. [Make a counteroffer and justify it based on apartment size]], [Summary: The conversation begins with a polite exchange before quickly moving to a negotiation about an apartment. The buyer expresses surprise and slight disappointment at the apartment's size and lack of amenities, prompting the seller to offer a price reduction. The buyer remains interested but uses the apartment's limitations as leverage to propose a lower price. Both parties maintain a cooperative tone, with the seller showing flexibility and the buyer expressing willingness to compromise if the price is adjusted.]><|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
