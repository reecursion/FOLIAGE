The buyer remains persistent in seeking a lower price, offering a significantly lower amount.

INPUT: <$947, $1895, [Seller: Hello [Greeting the buyer], Buyer: Hi there [Responding to the greeting], Seller: Interested in this property? [Inquiring about the buyer's interest in the property], Buyer: Yeah, but it looks like it might need some work that I would have to pay for, so I was hoping I could get it for $850 [Expressing interest and making an initial offer], Seller: I can't do that. It's been updated recently and has stainless steel appliances. It's a beautiful studio in a great neighborhood. 1895 is a steal [Rejecting the offer and justifying the property's value], Buyer: I can't do that. I could go up to $900, if it helps you out? [Reiterating inability to meet the asking price and making a counteroffer], Seller: That's crazy. A studio half the size went for 1800. How about 1650? Recently remodeled! [Rejecting the counteroffer and making a new offer], Buyer: It's not the size that I'm basing this on... it's the location and exterior. How about $1000? [Explaining the basis for their offer and making another counteroffer], Seller: Did I mention it comes with an offshores bank account with 500k? $1750. ;) [Attempting to add value humorously and making a higher counteroffer], Buyer: Wow, that sound shady. How about this... $1050 and I don't report you to the feds? ;) [Responding humorously and making another counteroffer], Seller: LOL. 1400 and you have a deal. [Responding humorously and making a final counteroffer]], [Summary: The conversation begins with the buyer expressing interest but concern over potential costs, leading to an initial low offer. The seller counters by emphasizing the property's recent updates and value, maintaining a firm stance on price. As negotiations continue, both parties employ humor and playful exaggeration to ease tension and attempt to sway the other. Ultimately, the seller becomes more flexible, reducing the price significantly while the buyer gradually increases their offer, showcasing a mutual willingness to compromise.]><|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

INPUT: <$1736, $2480, [Buyer: Hi, I am interested in this house. Can you tell what you think it is worth per month? [Express interest in the house and inquire about its monthly worth], Seller: 5 grand [State the monthly worth of the house], Buyer: That is ridiculous. I was thinking more around 1700 a month. [Express disagreement with the stated price and propose a lower amount], Seller: Well that's what its worth you can ask city hall if you want they will say 5 grand [Defend the stated price and suggest verification with city hall], Buyer: That is funny, because the original list price is only 2480. [Challenge the seller's price by referencing the original list price], Seller: Yeah that's for rent to own, but you have to rent it to own it [Clarify that the original price is for rent-to-own and emphasize the need to rent first], Buyer: I understand that. So if I wanted to do rent to own and I could set up a direct deposit, how about 1800 a month? [Show understanding and propose a new offer with a condition], Seller: That's already low can you afford 2 grand [Express reluctance and counter with a slightly higher amount], Buyer: I'll split it at 1900.

[Make a compromise offer and seek confirmation], Seller: Makes me think you won't be able to pay rent u low ballin [Express doubt about the buyer's ability to pay rent], Buyer: That will not be a issue. I said we could set it up as a direct deposit, so obviously I am not worried about having the money. 1950 is my final offer. [Reassure the seller about financial stability and make a final offer], Seller: Okay I can agree on 1950 if you can find me a way besides Direct deposit that you can prove to me you'll be able to make rent every month [Agree to the final offer with a condition for proof of financial stability]], [Summary: The conversation begins with a significant disparity in price expectations between the buyer and seller, leading to a tense negotiation. The buyer employs humor and persistence to challenge the seller's initial high price, gradually increasing their offer while emphasizing reliability through direct deposit. The seller remains skeptical but shows flexibility by lowering their price slightly. The conversation concludes with a tentative agreement contingent on the buyer proving their financial reliability through means other than direct deposit.]><|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

INPUT: <$836, $1100, [Buyer: Hi!  I am interested in your bike.  How long have you had it? [Express interest in the bike and inquire about its history], Seller: I'm glad you're interested. We've only had it for about 6 months. It only has about 50 miles on it! [Show appreciation for interest and provide information about the bike's usage], Buyer: That's definitely a plus!  My wife is an avid biker and I want to surprise her with a nice bike.  Something like this would normally be way out of my price range.  But, I figured I would give it a try. [Express positive sentiment and provide context for interest in the bike], Seller: Well my wife has definitely enjoyed it, so if yours is like mine I'm sure she will too! I've listed this at $1100 and I expect it to go quickly. [Share positive experience and set price expectation], Buyer: I won't argue that it is a decent price.  Just wondering, is there anything wrong with it?  Seems like a lot to spend on a bike that only has 50 miles of usage... [Express concern and seek reassurance about the bike's condition], Seller: I'm not aware of anything wrong with it - unless you count the fact that it's taking up space in my garage that I'd like to use for other things!

I'll throw in a birthday party invite. lol [Make an offer and add a humorous element]], [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly inquiry from the buyer, who expresses interest in the bike and shares a personal motivation for purchasing it. The seller responds warmly, emphasizing the bike's limited use and appealing to the buyer's situation. As the conversation progresses, the buyer acknowledges the price but subtly questions the value, leading to a light-hearted negotiation attempt. The seller maintains a positive tone, while the buyer employs humor to propose a lower offer, indicating a desire to negotiate.]><|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
