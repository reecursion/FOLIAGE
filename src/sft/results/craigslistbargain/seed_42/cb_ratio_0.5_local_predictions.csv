FINAL_PRICE: $90.0
Input Analysis: The negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price of three tables. The seller initiates the conversation, provides the price and condition of the tables, and asks for a response. The buyer apologizes for a late response, expresses interest in the tables, and negotiates the price. The seller asks for the buyer's offer, and the buyer proposes a lower price. The final price is not explicitly stated, but it lies between the buyer's offer of $70 and the seller's initial price of $100. Given the context and the intentions of the parties, a projected sale price of $90.0 seems reasonable.<|eot_id|>",70,100,85.0,90.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,0.2941176470588235

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a phone from a seller. The seller offers the phone and explains its purchase history, while the buyer inquires about the possibility of negotiating the price. Given the context, it appears that the buyer is trying to lower the price of the phone. However, the negotiation does not provide specific details about the phone's condition or the buyer's budget, which are crucial for determining a fair price. Therefore, predicting the exact price is challenging, but we can make an educated guess based on the given information. Since the buyer is interested in the phone and the seller is willing to sell, it's likely that they can come to a mutually agreeable price. Given the buyer's inquiry about negotiating the price, it's reasonable to assume they are willing to pay less than the asking price. However, without more information about the phone's condition and the buyer's budget, we can only make an educated guess. Given the buyer's target of $56 and the seller's target of $80, a reasonable guess would be to find a middle ground. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

In this negotiation, the buyer expresses interest in purchasing the item and requests details about it. The seller provides a positive description of the item's condition and characteristics. The buyer then asks for clarification on the item's usage status, which the seller explains. Finally, the buyer makes an initial offer of $114. Given the positive description of the item and the buyer's interest, it seems like the seller might be willing to negotiate. However, the negotiation is quite short and doesn't involve much back-and-forth. Therefore, it's difficult to predict the exact sale price, but it seems likely to be somewhere in the middle of the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation is relatively straightforward and doesn't involve complex price negotiations. The buyer is interested in purchasing the item but is skeptical about its condition. The seller assures the buyer that the item is brand new and in excellent condition. Given the details provided by the seller and the buyer's initial interest, it's reasonable to assume that the buyer is willing to pay a price that is close to the asking price. However, the buyer's skepticism may lead to some price negotiation. Since there is no explicit mention of a specific price to negotiate, and the details provided by the seller are positive, it's reasonable to assume that the final sale price will be close to the asking price.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a couch and a seller who is willing to negotiate the price. The buyer makes an initial offer of $190 and explains their financial situation to justify the lower price. The seller responds by reassuring the buyer about the item's condition and does not immediately counter the offer. Since the buyer has expressed financial constraints, it is likely that the seller will be willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price. Given the context, it seems like the buyer is a genuine customer and the seller is willing to work with them. Therefore, a reasonable projected sale price would be between the buyer and seller targets.FINAL_PRICE: $220.0<|eot_id|>",190,250,220.0,220.0,0.5,0.5,0.0

In this negotiation, the buyer initiates the conversation by complimenting the bike and inquiring about additional items. The seller provides detailed information about the bike's unique features and certification. The buyer expresses approval and makes a counteroffer of $140. However, there is no further negotiation, and the intentions are not clearly stated. Given the context, it seems like the buyer is interested in purchasing the bike, but the negotiation is incomplete. Since the intentions are unclear, it is difficult to predict the projected sale price. However, considering the buyer's counteroffer of $140, which is significantly lower than the seller's asking price of $250, and the lack of further negotiation, it is likely that the final sale price will be closer to the buyer's offer. Therefore, I will provide a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price and condition of a bike. The seller initiates the conversation and promotes the bike's price as fair. The buyer compliments the bike and inquires about its condition, which the seller answers by providing a condition rating and minor usage details. The buyer then asks for the bike's age, which the seller provides. The negotiation is friendly and informative, but no direct price negotiation is initiated. Given the context, it is likely that the buyer is interested in purchasing the bike and is seeking more information before making an offer. Since there is no explicit price negotiation, we can only predict the projected sale price based on the given targets. In this case, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, but given the context, it seems the buyer is willing to pay a lower price. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely closer to the buyer's target. FINAL_PRICE: $75.0<|eot_id|>",75,150,87.0,75.0,0.16,0.0,1.6551724137931034

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the condition and compatibility of a phone. The seller emphasizes the phone's perfect condition and provides information about its network compatibility. The buyer expresses interest and seeks confirmation about the phone's physical condition. Given the context, it appears that the buyer is interested in purchasing the phone but wants to ensure it meets their requirements. The seller is confident in the phone's condition and is willing to provide additional information to alleviate the buyer's concerns. Since the negotiation is still ongoing and no final agreement has been reached, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the buyer is willing to accept a lower price due to the phone's condition. Therefore, a projected sale price between the buyer and seller targets seems reasonable. Given this, I predict a sale price of $85, which lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the condition and price of a used GoPro Hero 3. The seller provides detailed information about the item, including its condition and included accessories. The buyer asks if the original box is included, and the seller confirms it is. The buyer then asks for the price, and the seller responds with the retail price and justifies it due to the item being slightly used. Given the context, it appears that the buyer is interested in purchasing the item but may negotiate the price. Since the seller has already provided a clear justification for the price and the buyer has not made any offers, it is likely that the buyer will accept the price or make a counteroffer close to it. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $130.0<|eot_id|>",98,130,120.0,130.0,0.6875,1.0,0.8333333333333334

Projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, so we will predict the final price. Given the context, the buyer is willing to offer $7500 and the seller is unwilling to accept it, so we need to predict a price that lies between $7500 and $15700. The buyer is interested in the vehicle and willing to negotiate, so we can assume they are willing to pay a higher price. Since the seller is unwilling to accept $7500, we can start by offering a slightly higher price and negotiating from there. Given the context, a reasonable final price could be $10500. However, since the final answer format requires a number, we will provide the final answer in the correct format.

In this negotiation, the seller is asking for $110 for the circuit breakers, but the buyer doesn't seem interested in paying that amount. The buyer doesn't make an offer, but they do ask about the price. The negotiation is quite brief and doesn't involve any counter-offers or negotiations. Given this information, it's likely that the buyer is not interested in purchasing the circuit breakers at the listed price, but the seller is firm on the price. Therefore, it's difficult to predict a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. However, since the buyer doesn't make an offer, it's possible that the negotiation failed, and the sale didn't occur. But, given the lack of information, it's hard to determine the final outcome. Given the context, I will choose a price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $100.0<|eot_id|>",55,110,90.0,100.0,0.6363636363636364,0.8181818181818182,1.1111111111111112

In this negotiation, the seller initially offers the item for $30. The buyer inquires about the availability and dimensions of the item. The seller confirms the item is still available and provides the height of the item. The buyer then asks about the color of the item. There is no direct negotiation or counteroffer from the buyer, but given the lack of specific questions about price, it seems the buyer is interested in the item. The seller's willingness to sell and provide details suggests they are motivated to sell. Without further negotiation, it's difficult to predict the exact sale price, but given the context, it seems the buyer is likely to accept the initial offer. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $30.0<|eot_id|>",21,30,25.0,30.0,0.4444444444444444,1.0,1.0

In this negotiation, the buyer initiates a conversation to inquire about the availability and details of the FitBit Flex and bands being sold. The seller confirms availability and provides details about the bands included. The buyer expresses approval and makes an offer of $40. However, the seller does not immediately respond to the offer. Given the lack of response and the absence of further negotiation, it is difficult to determine the projected sale price. However, since the buyer's offer of $40 is close to the seller's target of $60 and there is no indication of the seller's willingness to negotiate further, it is reasonable to assume that the projected sale price lies somewhere between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, I will provide a projected sale price that falls within this range.

This negotiation is for a rental property. The buyer is interested in taking up residence and inquires about the area and lease terms. The seller provides positive information about the area and confirms the lease terms. There is no mention of price or negotiation, so we can assume the price is not negotiable or was already agreed upon. Given this context, it's reasonable to assume the buyer and seller have already agreed on a price, and the provided targets are likely the actual prices. Therefore, we can predict the projected sale price to be between the given targets. FINAL_PRICE: $1256.0<|eot_id|>",1256,1795,1500.0,1256.0,0.4526901669758812,0.0,39.690666666666665

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in a service offered by the seller and is willing to negotiate the price. The seller explains the service provided and seems open to negotiating the price. The buyer initiates the negotiation by asking if the seller is willing to negotiate, indicating a willingness to come to a mutually agreeable price. Given the context and intentions, it seems likely that the buyer and seller can come to a mutually agreeable price between $45 and $50. However, without more information about the specifics of the service and the buyer's budget, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact number.

In this negotiation, the buyer is trying to purchase a television from the seller and make an initial offer of $75. The seller rejects this offer and explains that the item is only a few months old and worth more than the buyer's offer. The buyer then requests more information about the item, indicating a continued interest in purchasing it. Since the buyer is still interested in the item, it is likely that the negotiation will continue, and the final price may be negotiated between the buyer and seller. However, given the initial offer and the seller's justification, it is clear that the seller is unwilling to accept the buyer's offer of $75. The buyer's request for more information suggests that they are willing to consider a higher price, but the seller has already stated that they cannot accept the buyer's initial offer. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that the final price will be closer to the seller's target of $200. However, since the buyer is willing to negotiate, the final price may be slightly lower than the seller's target. Given the context, a reasonable prediction for the final price is $175.0.

Since the buyer has expressed interest in the bed and has initiated a price negotiation, it is reasonable to assume they are willing to make an offer. Given the excellent condition of the items and the fact that the buyer is interested, it is likely the seller will be willing to negotiate. However, there is not enough information to accurately predict the exact price the buyer will offer. Since the buyer initiated the price negotiation, it is likely they will propose a lower price than the original $275. Given the excellent condition and the fact that the buyer is interested, it is likely the seller will accept a price lower than $275 but higher than $137. Therefore, a reasonable projection for the sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

In this negotiation, the seller is offering a GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition with a water-proof case for sale. The buyer is interested in purchasing the product and requests more information about it. The seller provides details about the product, indicating that it is available. There is no indication of any issues with the product, and the buyer is interested in buying it. Since the seller is providing detailed information about the product and the buyer is interested, it is likely that the sale will proceed without any significant price negotiation.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a Galaxy Tab. The seller provides information about the product's condition and confirms it is new and in good condition. The buyer asks about additional accessories included with the product, specifically a charger. The negotiation seems to be going smoothly, but there is no mention of price or any attempts to negotiate it. Given the lack of price discussion, it's difficult to predict the sale price. However, since the seller confirmed the product is new and in good condition, and there are no apparent issues, it's possible that the sale price could be closer to the seller's target of $300. Therefore, I will provide a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $250.0<|eot_id|>",228,300,250.0,250.0,0.3055555555555556,0.3055555555555556,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a charming bungalow and a seller who is asking a price of $3000. The buyer expresses concern about the price being too high for their budget and inquires about the possibility of negotiating the price down. The seller justifies the price by highlighting the property's benefits, such as its location, amenities, and convenience. Given the context and intentions, it seems that the buyer is willing to negotiate the price but the seller is firm in their asking price. Since the buyer has already expressed concern about the price being too high, it is likely that the final sale price will be lower than the seller's initial asking price. However, the buyer has not yet made a specific offer, so it's difficult to determine the exact final price. Given the context, I would predict the final sale price to be closer to the buyer's target of $2100. However, considering the seller's justification, it's possible that the final price could be slightly higher. Therefore, I will predict the final sale price to be between the buyer and seller targets.

The negotiation is about purchasing a used corvette. The buyer is interested in the car and asks about its condition. The seller provides detailed information about the car's condition, mentioning some issues with overheating. The buyer seems to be concerned about the condition but is still interested in purchasing the car. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer will negotiate the price due to the car's condition. However, the seller does not provide a clear indication of how much they are willing to lower the price. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the exact final price. Since the buyer is interested in the car and the seller seems willing to negotiate, a reasonable estimate for the final price would be around $2800, which lies between the given targets. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual final price may vary based on further negotiation.

In this negotiation, the seller is offering a brand new iPhone 7, and the buyer is interested in purchasing it. The buyer wants to meet the seller to ensure the product is in good working order. The seller agrees to meet and reassures the buyer about the product's features. Since the buyer is interested in purchasing the product and the seller is willing to meet, it seems like a genuine sale. However, there is no direct discussion of the price, so it's difficult to determine the final price. Given the lack of price negotiation, we can make an educated guess that lies between the buyer and seller targets. Considering the product is brand new and the buyer is interested in purchasing it, a reasonable price would likely be closer to the seller's target of $600. Therefore, the final price lies between $300 and $600.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing storage drawers and a seller willing to sell them. The buyer inquires about the lockability of the drawers and receives confirmation from the seller. The buyer then makes a counteroffer of $15 and suggests immediate pickup. However, the seller does not immediately respond to this offer. Given the lack of immediate response from the seller, it is likely that the buyer's offer was not accepted. Since the buyer's offer is lower than the seller's asking price, it is reasonable to assume that the negotiation will continue with the buyer trying to negotiate a lower price. Therefore, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets is $20.0. FINAL_PRICE: $20.0<|eot_id|>",21,30,25.0,20.0,0.4444444444444444,-0.1111111111111111,1.0

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in renting a home, but the seller has clearly stated it is for sale. The buyer then negotiates the price, offering $1500, which is significantly lower than the seller's asking price of $3000. However, there is no indication that the seller is willing to accept this lower price. Therefore, it is likely that the negotiation will not be successful in achieving the buyer's target price. Given the lack of willingness to negotiate on the seller's part and the significant difference in the buyer's and seller's targets, it is reasonable to predict that the projected sale price will be closer to the seller's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike listed by a seller. The buyer expresses admiration for the bike and requests more information. The seller provides positive details about the bike's condition and performance. The buyer then negotiates the price, proposing a lower offer of $699 due to budget constraints. The seller declines the offer and counteroffers with $825. Given this context, we can predict the projected sale price. Since the buyer is on a strict budget and the seller is unwilling to go as low as $699, the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the seller's original asking price. However, the buyer's initial offer and the seller's counteroffer suggest some room for negotiation. Therefore, the projected sale price should lie between the buyer and seller targets.

In this negotiation, the buyer expresses interest in the chair and inquires about the height of the stool. The seller apologizes for a previous confusion and offers to answer questions. Since there is no mention of the price or any negotiation, we can assume the negotiation is still in its initial stages. Given the lack of information about the condition or specific features of the chair, it's difficult to predict the projected sale price. However, considering the buyer's interest and the seller's willingness to answer questions, it's reasonable to assume the buyer is interested in purchasing the chair. Therefore, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets could be estimated. FINAL_PRICE: $8.0<|eot_id|>",6,10,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a home and inquiring about its details, such as the location and furnishing status. The seller provides information about the location and furnishing, and the buyer clarifies the details. The conversation is friendly and informative, with the buyer showing genuine interest in the property. Since the negotiation is initiated to gather information, there is no apparent intent to haggle or negotiate the price. Therefore, it is likely that the buyer and seller are on the same page, and the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation is relatively straightforward and doesn't involve any complex offers or counteroffers. The buyer expresses interest in the apartment and asks for basic information about parking and the area. The seller provides the necessary information and assures the buyer of the apartment's proximity to good restaurants and the beach. The buyer then inquires about the safety of the area. There is no indication of any issues or concerns that would necessitate a significant price reduction. Given the lack of complex negotiations and the straightforward exchange, it's reasonable to assume that the sale price remains intact. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $1395.0<|eot_id|>",837,1395,950.0,1395.0,0.2025089605734767,1.0,208.44736842105263

This negotiation seems to be about a rental property. The seller provides information about the property's condition and location, and the buyer expresses interest and seeks clarification on credit check and deposit requirements. The negotiation is straightforward, with the seller providing details and the buyer asking questions. There is no apparent conflict or bargaining in this negotiation. Given this context, it seems like the buyer is serious about renting the property and is seeking more information before making a decision. Since the negotiation is so straightforward, it's difficult to predict a specific sale price, but it appears to be a rental agreement rather than a sale. However, I can predict the projected sale price by considering the provided information and typical rental prices in the area. Given the lack of information about the property's specifics and the fact that it's a rental, I will make an educated guess.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the details of a car for sale. The buyer inquires about the mileage and potential issues with the car. The seller provides the mileage information and apologizes for a delayed response. The buyer expresses understanding and asks about potential issues. The negotiation is polite and courteous, with no direct offers or counteroffers made. Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that the negotiation is in its early stages, and the parties are establishing a rapport and gathering information. Since there are no specific details about the car's condition or any defects, it's difficult to predict a projected sale price. However, the seller's initial offer of $3500 suggests that the car is in relatively good condition. Given the lack of information about the car's condition and the absence of any negotiations, it's challenging to provide an accurate projected sale price. However, considering the initial offer and the fact that there are no defects mentioned, a reasonable projection might be slightly lower than the seller's initial offer. Therefore, I will provide a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

Projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Given the intentions and the context, it seems like the seller is quite firm on the price, and the buyer is trying to negotiate a lower price. However, the seller has already mentioned that they have other offers, which suggests they are not willing to go as low as the buyer is suggesting. The best offer the buyer can make is $110, which is below the seller's minimum of $210. Therefore, it's likely that the negotiation will end with the buyer unable to reach the seller's minimum price. The projected sale price is likely to be around $210, which is the seller's minimum. FINAL_PRICE: $210.0<|eot_id|>",110,220,175.0,210.0,0.5909090909090909,0.9090909090909092,7.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike and a seller offering it for sale. The buyer inquires about the condition and transportation logistics of the bike, and the seller provides relevant information and offers delivery service. There is no direct negotiation of the price in this conversation. However, given the context, it appears that the buyer is interested in purchasing the bike, and the seller is willing to provide additional services (delivery) to facilitate the sale. The absence of a direct price negotiation suggests that the price may not be open to negotiation. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the price of an item. The seller initially sets the price at $200, but the buyer finds it too high and proposes a lower offer of $100. The seller justifies the price by mentioning an upgrade and makes a counteroffer of $165. The buyer then asks for more information about the item's age to better assess its value. Given this context, we can predict the projected sale price. The buyer's initial offer of $100 is low, and the seller's counteroffer of $165 is closer to the original price. The buyer's inquiry about the item's age suggests they are interested in the item but want more information before making a decision. Since the buyer is interested but wants more information, they may be willing to meet the seller halfway. Therefore, a projected sale price between $120 and $200 seems reasonable. Given this, I predict the projected sale price to be $150. However, since the buyer's offer of $100 is too low, we need to find a price between $165 (seller's counteroffer) and $120 (buyer's target). A fair price that lies between these two targets would be $155. However, the buyer is not yet willing to accept this price, so we need to find a price that lies between $155 and $165. Given the context, a price of $160 seems like a fair compromise. However, this is still too high for the buyer, so we need to find a price that lies between $160 and $165. A fair price that lies between these two targets would be $162.5. However, this is still too high for the buyer, so we need to find a price that lies between $162.5 and $165. A fair price that lies between these two targets would be $162.5. However, this is still too high for the buyer, so we need to find a price that lies between $162.5 and $165.

In this negotiation, the buyer is concerned about the condition of the TV and makes an initial offer of $350. The seller clarifies that the TV is in perfect condition and rejects the offer. The buyer then inquires about the inclusion of a dollhouse, which is not included. The seller assures that the TV is in excellent condition. Given this information, it seems that the buyer is still interested in purchasing the TV, but the seller is unwilling to negotiate the price significantly. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $400.0<|eot_id|>",363,395,375.0,400.0,0.375,1.15625,1.6666666666666667

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the availability and condition of a car, and the seller providing information about the car's mileage and features. The buyer is interested in purchasing the car but wants to negotiate the price. The seller is open to negotiation but does not provide any significant discounts in the given conversation. Given the limited information, it's difficult to predict the exact sale price, but we can infer that the buyer is interested in purchasing the car and the seller is willing to negotiate. However, without more details about the buyer's budget or the seller's willingness to discount, it's challenging to predict the exact sale price. Therefore, I will provide a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in purchasing a car and inquiring about its features and mileage. The seller shares their personal experience with the backup camera and highlights its usefulness. The buyer makes an offer, indicating their willingness to purchase the car. Given the limited information provided, it is challenging to predict the exact sale price. However, considering the buyer's initial offer and the seller's positive response, it seems that the sale is likely to occur at a price close to the buyer's offer. Therefore, a reasonable projection would be slightly above the buyer's offer but below the seller's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in renting an apartment and attempting to negotiate the price. The seller provides information about the apartment's recent remodeling and convenient location. The buyer makes a specific offer of $800, which the seller does not immediately respond to. Given the lack of immediate response from the seller, it is reasonable to assume that the buyer's offer is not accepted. However, the negotiation is incomplete, and a final price is not established. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the exact final sale price. However, considering the buyer's offer and the fact that the seller does not immediately reject it, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets could be $1200, which is a reasonable compromise between the two targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a privacy tent from a seller. The seller is motivated to sell the tent and provides information about its usage and condition. The buyer expresses interest and asks questions about the item's history. Given the buyer's interest and the seller's motivation to sell, it is likely that they will negotiate the price. However, the negotiation is limited, and there is no clear indication of the buyer's budget constraints. The seller provides a price of $15, but the buyer does not respond with a specific offer. In the absence of more detailed information, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. However, since the buyer has expressed interest and the seller is motivated to sell, a reasonable estimate for the sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Given the limited information, I will provide a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $10.0<|eot_id|>",7,15,12.0,10.0,0.625,0.375,0.3333333333333333

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a truck and a seller who is willing to negotiate the price. The buyer offers $600, citing the high mileage as a reason for the lower offer. The seller clarifies the listed price and indicates a willingness to negotiate if the buyer can pick up the truck immediately. Given this information, we can predict the projected sale price. The buyer's initial offer is low, and the seller is willing to negotiate, but there is no indication of how much the seller is willing to lower the price. Therefore, a reasonable projection would be slightly above the buyer's initial offer, but not as high as the seller's initial price.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in renting a place and the seller confirming its availability. The buyer explains that the place would be perfect for them and their classmates due to its proximity to campus. The seller invites questions about the place and the buyer inquires about included amenities. Given this information, it seems like the buyer is interested in renting the place and is seeking more details about it. Since the buyer has not explicitly stated their budget or made an offer, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. However, the buyer's interest and the seller's confirmation of availability suggest a potential sale. To predict the sale price, we need more information about the buyer's budget and the seller's willingness to negotiate. Since this information is not provided, I will provide a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a car from a seller. The buyer inquires about the car's history and condition, and the seller provides information about the car's clean carfax report and minor accident history. The buyer then asks about the car's mileage, and the seller responds with the car's mileage and additional benefits such as good gas mileage. Given the buyer's interest and the seller's positive responses, it is likely that the negotiation will result in a sale. However, the buyer does not make an initial offer, and the seller does not provide a significant discount, indicating that the projected sale price may be closer to the seller's target. Therefore, I predict that the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $5995.0<|eot_id|>",5395,5995,5400.0,5995.0,0.0083333333333333,1.0,65.56018518518519

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in renting a home and inquiring about its details. The seller provides information about the community's safety and pet policies. The buyer seems interested but does not make a formal offer. To predict the projected sale price, we need to analyze the intentions and needs of both parties. Given the lack of a direct offer from the buyer, it is challenging to predict the exact price. However, the buyer's interest and the seller's willingness to provide information suggest a potential negotiation. Without more specific details about the buyer's budget or needs, it is difficult to predict the exact price. However, considering the buyer's interest and the seller's positive description, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets could be around $1500. This is a rough estimate and may not accurately reflect the final price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a Casper mattress and a seller willing to negotiate the price. The buyer expresses enthusiasm and interest in the product, explains their personal context (moving into a new place and wanting to upgrade their mattress), and inquires about price negotiation. The seller agrees to negotiate and shows flexibility, indicating a willingness to give a good deal. The buyer then proposes a specific price of $150, which is lower than the seller's target. Given the buyer's enthusiasm and the seller's flexibility, it is likely that the negotiation will result in a price between the buyer's and seller's targets. However, the exact amount will depend on the seller's willingness to compromise.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a product but expressing concern about the price being too high. The seller assures the buyer about the product's condition and compatibility. The buyer indicates that the price is not within their budget and expresses interest in purchasing the product. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer will negotiate the price with the seller. However, the details provided do not offer explicit intentions for price negotiation. To predict the projected sale price, we need to infer from the conversation. The buyer has expressed interest in purchasing the product but feels the price is too high. The seller has provided assurance about the product's condition and compatibility. The buyer is likely to negotiate the price, but the exact amount is not specified. In the absence of specific details for price negotiation, we can make an educated guess based on the given information. Given that the buyer feels the price is too high, a reasonable projection for the sale price would be slightly lower than the seller's target. Therefore, I will choose a number that is closer to the seller's target but still slightly lower.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a car and a seller who is willing to negotiate the price. The buyer starts by inquiring about the lack of pictures for the car and the seller explains the issue with their camera. The buyer then asks for the seller's favorite thing about the car, and the seller shares positive aspects of the car's smooth ride and color. The buyer proposes a lower price of $5000, justifying it as fair market value. The seller defends the current price but shows willingness to negotiate, stating that $5000 is too low. Given this information, we can predict the projected sale price. The buyer's initial offer is $5000, which is lower than the seller's asking price of $7800. The seller is willing to negotiate but feels $5000 is too low. A reasonable negotiation would likely result in a price between the buyer's offer and the seller's asking price.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a stereo system and the seller offering it for $40. The buyer makes a counteroffer of $20, which is significantly lower than the seller's price. Given the large gap between the buyer's offer and the seller's asking price, it's likely that the negotiation will involve some give-and-take. However, without more information about the buyer's needs and the seller's flexibility, it's difficult to predict the exact outcome. To make an educated guess, we can consider the fact that the buyer is showing some interest in the stereo and is making an offer, indicating that they are willing to negotiate. The seller's response is not explicitly stated in the given negotiation, but based on the context, it is reasonable to assume that the seller might be willing to negotiate the price. Given these factors, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets could be $30. This lies between the buyer's offer of $20 and the seller's asking price of $40.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a flip phone from a seller. The buyer inquires about the phone's usage and the availability of additional accessories, specifically a headset or hands-free capabilities. The seller provides information about the phone's usage and does not mention any additional accessories. The buyer seems to be interested in the phone and is seeking more details about its condition and compatibility. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer will make an offer for the phone, and the seller may be willing to negotiate the price. However, without more information about the buyer's budget or the seller's willingness to negotiate, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. Since the buyer is interested in the phone and the seller does not mention any issues with it, the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the buyer's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller who are discussing the price of a table. The buyer initiates the conversation and makes an initial offer of $40. The seller counters with an offer of $80. The buyer expresses that this is still too high and makes a new offer of $50. The seller has not yet responded to the buyer's new offer, but given the context, it is likely that the seller will continue to negotiate to reach a mutually acceptable price. However, without further information, it is difficult to predict the exact outcome. Since the seller has already shown flexibility by reducing the price from the original $95 to $80, it is possible that they may be willing to meet the buyer's new offer. Given this, a reasonable projection for the sale price would be slightly higher than the buyer's offer but lower than the seller's counteroffer. Therefore, a projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $70.0<|eot_id|>",57,95,70.0,70.0,0.3421052631578947,0.3421052631578947,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing binoculars from a seller. The buyer expresses concern about the neighbors' activities and inquires about the suitability of the binoculars for spying. The seller assures the buyer that the binoculars are suitable for the purpose and highlights additional features such as the ability to hook up to wifi and work in night conditions. The buyer then makes an initial offer of $250, explaining that they would like to offer more but have had their money stolen by the neighbors. The seller does not directly respond to the buyer's financial situation but continues to emphasize the value of the binoculars. Given this context, it seems that the seller is interested in selling the binoculars but is not willing to accept the initial offer. The buyer's financial situation and the seller's emphasis on the binoculars' value suggest that the negotiation may continue with the buyer attempting to justify their initial offer or propose a higher amount. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $300.0<|eot_id|>",266,380,300.0,300.0,0.2982456140350877,0.2982456140350877,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in renting a property and the seller providing information about the location. The buyer expresses approval of the location and inquires about the possibility of negotiating the price. Given the limited information, we can infer that the buyer is interested in the property and is willing to negotiate the price. However, there is no specific mention of the current price or the buyer's budget. To predict the projected sale price, we need more information about the current price and the buyer's budget. Since the current information is limited, I will provide a neutral answer that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike and a seller who is willing to answer questions about the bike's condition and suitability. The buyer inquires about the bike's suitability for a tall person and the seller assures them it is suitable. The buyer also asks about the age of the bike and the seller provides this information. There is no direct negotiation on the price, but the buyer expresses interest in the bike. Given the lack of direct price negotiation and the buyer's expressed interest, it is reasonable to assume that the buyer is likely to purchase the bike at a price close to the seller's asking price. However, without explicit price negotiation, we can only make an educated guess. Given the buyer's interest and the seller's assurance about the bike's condition, I predict a price slightly lower than the seller's asking price.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in purchasing a car and inquiring about its condition and price. The seller provides information about the car's mileage and condition, but the buyer is concerned about the salvaged title. The seller explains the reason for the salvaged title, but the buyer is still skeptical. Given the buyer's concerns and the fact that the car has a salvaged title, it's likely that the buyer will negotiate the price downward. However, the seller has already set a price of $4700, which suggests that they are not willing to negotiate much. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the seller's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about details of a rental house and the seller providing information about the property. The buyer expresses interest in the house and requests more information before discussing the price. The seller provides details about the bedrooms and mentions transit options. The buyer asks about the inclusion of utilities in the rent. The negotiation is polite and focused on gathering information. Given the lack of price discussion, it's difficult to predict the exact sale price. However, since the buyer is interested and the seller is providing information, a reasonable projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in purchasing a bike that holds sentimental value to the seller. The seller is willing to negotiate the price, contingent on the buyer picking up the bike immediately. The buyer indicates a willingness to negotiate the price, but no specific amount is mentioned. Given the emotional value of the bike to the seller, it is likely that the buyer will offer a price that is somewhat lower than the seller's initial offer. However, the buyer's willingness to negotiate and the seller's conditional price offer suggest that a mutually acceptable price lies between $120 and $240. To predict the projected sale price, I will consider the buyer's willingness to negotiate and the seller's conditional offer. Since the buyer is interested in purchasing the bike and the seller is willing to negotiate, it is likely that they can come to an agreement near the lower end of the price range. Therefore, I predict that the projected sale price lies between $120 and $240. Given the emotional value of the bike and the buyer's interest in purchasing it, I predict the final sale price to be $200.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in renting a one-bedroom apartment and a seller providing details about the apartment's features and policies. The buyer expresses enthusiasm for the kitchen and inquires about furnishings and laundry facilities. The seller clarifies that the apartment is not furnished and mentions the availability of on-site laundry facilities. Given the buyer's interest and the seller's detailed responses, there is a clear willingness to negotiate the price. However, the negotiation does not explicitly involve price discussions. To predict the projected sale price, we can consider the context and the intentions expressed during the negotiation. Since the buyer is interested in renting and the seller is providing detailed information, it is reasonable to assume that the buyer is likely to accept the basic terms and conditions of the rental agreement. The lack of explicit price negotiation suggests that the buyer may be willing to accept the original price or negotiate slightly. Given these considerations, a reasonable projection for the sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

Projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. In this negotiation, the seller initially agrees to the buyer's offer of $133, but then the buyer offers additional money for delivery. Given this, it is reasonable to assume that the seller might accept the new offer. Since the buyer is offering $140 and throwing in $7 for delivery, the total offer is $147. However, there is no explicit rejection from the seller, so it's possible that the seller might accept this offer. Therefore, predicting the sale price to lie between the buyer and seller targets, I would choose a value that is closer to the buyer's offer but still slightly higher.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike from a seller. The buyer inquires about the condition of the bike's seat, and the seller confirms it is in great condition. The conversation is brief and straightforward, with no significant conflicts or concessions.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in an apartment and inquiring about the neighborhood and its proximity to a college. The seller provides positive information about the neighborhood, highlighting its beauty and proximity to amenities. The buyer seeks further clarification on the walking distance to the college. Given the lack of specific details about the buyer's financial situation or any counteroffer, it is reasonable to assume that the negotiation is in its initial stages. The buyer's interest and the seller's positive description suggest a potential sale, but the negotiation requires more details to determine the exact price the buyer is willing to pay. Therefore, predicting the exact sale price is challenging without more information. However, considering the buyer's interest and the seller's positive description, it is reasonable to assume that the sale price will be closer to the buyer's target than the seller's. Given this, a projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $1300.0<|eot_id|>",1237,1375,1300.0,1300.0,0.4565217391304347,0.4565217391304347,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a solid oak wood antique vanity and dresser from a seller. The buyer initiates the conversation by greeting the seller and inquiring about their well-being. The seller responds by reciprocating the greeting and expressing gratitude for the inquiry, then confirms the buyer's interest in the items. The buyer does not make any specific offers or negotiate the price in this initial conversation. Given the lack of price negotiation in the provided negotiation, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. However, since the buyer does not make any offers and the conversation is brief, it is reasonable to assume that the sale price might be closer to the seller's target of $650. Therefore, I will predict the projected sale price to be slightly lower than the seller's target, but closer to it.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing 10 phones from a seller. The buyer expresses financial constraints and makes a lower offer of $20, citing recent financial difficulties due to being ripped off on phone orders. The seller confirms the availability and condition of the phones but does not negotiate the price directly. The buyer does not provide additional justification for the lower offer, and the seller does not respond with a counteroffer. Given this, it is reasonable to assume that the buyer's financial constraints are not being met with empathy or concession from the seller.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a night stand from the seller. The seller provides information about the item's condition and value while also expressing a personal reason for selling due to a family heirloom being passed down. The buyer expresses sympathy and inquires about the price, to which the seller responds with the original value and a willingness to negotiate. Given this context, it is reasonable to predict that the buyer and seller will engage in some price negotiation. However, the seller has already stated a willingness to go lower than the listed value, indicating flexibility in the price. The buyer's initial question about the price suggests they are interested in purchasing but need to know the cost. The seller's response provides a starting point for negotiation. Given these intentions, it is likely that the buyer and seller will engage in some negotiation, but the seller has already shown flexibility in the price. Therefore, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets seems reasonable. Since the exact intentions and final agreement are not specified, I will provide a projected sale price that lies between the given targets.

In this negotiation, the buyer expresses interest in viewing the house and negotiates the price. The seller agrees to a viewing and inquires about the buyer's budget. The buyer offers $1350, which the seller counters with $2300. The buyer then asks if the seller is willing to lower the price. The seller indicates that $1350 is too low but does not provide a specific counteroffer. The negotiation seems to be ongoing, but no final agreement is reached. Given this information, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price, but we can infer that the buyer is willing to pay a lower price than the seller's initial offer. A reasonable projection for the sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $1900.0<|eot_id|>",1375,2750,2300.0,1900.0,0.6727272727272727,0.3818181818181818,69.56521739130434

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the details of a bike for sale and the seller providing information about its condition. The buyer is concerned about the bike's storage conditions and asks if there is rust on it. The seller assures the buyer that the bike has been stored in a garage and is in good condition. The seller also mentions that the bike looks like new and states the price as $1300. The buyer does not make a counteroffer in this conversation, but the negotiation is still ongoing. Since the buyer does not make a counteroffer, we can assume that the buyer is interested in the bike but wants to negotiate the price. Given the lack of specific details about the bike's condition and the buyer's concerns, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price, but we can assume it will be between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between $780 and $1300. Since the buyer does not make a counteroffer, we can assume the sale price will be closer to the seller's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a car (Roush Mustang) and the seller providing details about the car's condition and price. The buyer inquires about the car's paint and mileage, and the seller responds with relevant information. The negotiation is straightforward and lacks any significant conflicts or concessions. Given the lack of complex negotiation and the fact that the buyer is simply inquiring about the car's details, it's reasonable to predict that the sale will occur at a price close to the seller's target. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price of a used iPhone. The buyer expresses interest in the phone but feels the asking price of $350 is too high. The seller provides additional information about the phone's condition and is willing to negotiate the price. The buyer offers $225, which the seller rejects but makes a counteroffer of $325 ($50 off the original price). Given the context and intentions, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer is willing to negotiate but has a limited budget, and the seller is somewhat flexible with the price, a reasonable projection would be to find a middle ground between the two targets. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the buyer's target of $224. However, considering the seller's initial price and the fact that they are willing to negotiate, a slight increase from the buyer's target seems reasonable. Hence, a projected sale price of $250 seems like a fair and reasonable offer that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the availability and condition of a bicycle. The seller confirms the availability and provides detailed information about the condition, mentioning that the bicycle is used but has been restored to a like-new condition by a bike mechanic. Given the buyer's initial offer of $42 and the seller's confirmation that the bicycle is in good condition, it is reasonable to assume that the buyer would be willing to pay a higher price. However, without more information about the buyer's budget or preferences, it is difficult to predict the exact price they would be willing to pay. Considering the fact that the seller has restored the bicycle to a like-new condition, it is likely that the buyer would be willing to pay a price closer to the seller's asking price of $60.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike listed by the seller. The buyer is concerned about the authenticity of the photo and seeks more details about the bike's height and brake type. The seller provides the necessary information, confirming the bike's authenticity, providing an approximate height suitable for kids, and specifying that it has a hand brake. Given the lack of specific details about the bike's condition and the buyer's concerns, it's challenging to predict the exact sale price. However, since the buyer is interested and the seller has provided the necessary information, a reasonable projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer's target is $92 and the seller's target is $100, a fair projection would be slightly above the buyer's target but below the seller's target, considering the buyer's interest and the seller's willingness to provide information. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be around $95. FINAL_PRICE: $95.0<|eot_id|>",92,100,92.0,95.0,0.0,0.375,0.0978260869565217

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a yoga bike and a seller willing to negotiate the price. The buyer expresses interest in the item and states they cannot pay the listed price of $100. The seller shows willingness to negotiate and asks if the buyer can pick up the item. The buyer confirms they can pick up the item and seeks clarification on the new price. Given the context, it seems like the buyer is willing to make a lower offer, but the exact amount is not specified. The seller is open to negotiating, indicating a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. To predict the projected sale price, we can infer that the buyer is likely to make a lower offer, but the exact amount is not specified. Given the context, a reasonable projection would be to assume the buyer will make an offer that is lower than $100 but not drastically lower. A reasonable projection would be $75, which lies between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be $75, which lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in purchasing a home and initiating price negotiation. The seller is willing to negotiate the price but also requests references and a security deposit. Given the context, it seems like the buyer is making a reasonable offer and the seller is open to negotiation. To predict the projected sale price, we can analyze the intentions and the facts provided in the negotiation. The buyer is interested in the home and is making an initial offer, while the seller is open to negotiation but also requires references and a security deposit. This suggests that the negotiation will involve some back-and-forth but ultimately, the parties are interested in reaching an agreement. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the buyer's initial offer but may still be higher due to the seller's requirements. Given these dynamics, a reasonable projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $2450.0<|eot_id|>",2340,2600,2340.0,2450.0,0.0,0.4230769230769231,5.170940170940171

Hello, I'd like to assist you with your request. Given the negotiation provided, I will do my best to predict the projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. Please note that this is just an estimate and actual negotiation outcomes may vary. [Initiate conversation and set expectations], Buyer: Hey, this place sounds nice, but a little bit out of my price range. Why should I pay so much for it? [Express interest but concern about price and seek justification], Seller: East Davis is a very popular right now and this price is pretty consistent with other similar units in the area. There are two bedrooms and two baths so there is plenty of space for two roommates! [Justify the price by highlighting the popularity and features of the apartment], Buyer: What's in the area? [Inquire about the neighborhood amenities], Seller: Plenty of cafes, restaurants, and shopping all within 5 blocks! It's a very hot area right now. [Provide information about local amenities to increase appeal], Buyer: I think I could go $1000. [Make an initial offer], Seller: I could do $1600 and throw in a parking space. [Counter the offer and add a new incentive]]> Given the negotiation, the buyer is expressing interest but has concerns about the price. The seller is justifying the price by highlighting the popularity and features of the apartment. The buyer is inquiring about the neighborhood amenities, which the seller is providing. The buyer makes an initial offer of $1000, and the seller counters with $1600 and adds a new incentive (parking space). This suggests that the buyer is somewhat flexible on price but the seller is firm on the price and is willing to negotiate. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. I predict that the final sale price will be closer to the seller's target, but given the buyer's initial offer and the seller's slight concession, I will estimate the projected sale price to be $1450.

INPUT: <$30, $50, [Buyer: Hey there how are you? [Initiate conversation and establish rapport], Seller: I'm fine, thank you. [Respond politely and acknowledge the greeting], Buyer: I see you have that nice sub box, how low are you willing to go on it? [Express interest in the item and inquire about the lowest price], Seller: Well, when you consider the fine crafstmanship, and the fact that it will universally fit in some vehicles, I think $50 is a steal.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a dresser and night stand from a seller who is moving out of the country. The buyer initiates the conversation by inquiring about the seller's well-being and complimenting the items for sale. The seller responds positively and provides context for selling the items due to their relocation. The buyer expresses sympathy and inquires about additional items, specifically a night stand. The seller confirms the presence of a night stand and provides brand information. The negotiation is friendly and informative, with the buyer showing interest in the items and the seller providing details about the items and their situation.

Given the context, it appears that the buyer is interested in purchasing the items and the seller is willing to negotiate the price due to their relocation. However, there is no explicit mention of a price negotiation in the given conversation. To predict the projected sale price, we need to infer the intentions and interests of the parties involved.

Based on the conversation, the buyer is interested in purchasing the items and the seller is willing to negotiate the price. However, the conversation does not provide specific details about the price or the buyer's budget. Since the buyer is interested in purchasing the items, it is likely that they will make an offer that is closer to their budget. Given the buyer's initial compliment and friendly tone, it is possible that they may be willing to pay a slightly higher price than their initial budget. However, without more information about the buyer's budget or the seller's minimum acceptable price, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price.

To make an educated guess, let's consider the following: the buyer is interested in purchasing the items, the seller is willing to negotiate, and there is no mention of any significant defects or issues with the items. Given these factors, it is possible that the buyer may be willing to pay a price that is slightly higher than their initial budget. However, the conversation does not provide enough information to make a precise prediction.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in renting a property listed near Emeryville. The buyer initially offers $1347, which the seller rejects as too low. The seller counteroffers with $2200 and includes the utilities in the offer. The buyer asks for the cost of utilities per month. Given this context, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer's offer is significantly lower than the seller's counteroffer, and the seller has already made a concession by including utilities in the counteroffer, it is reasonable to expect the final price to be closer to the seller's counteroffer than the buyer's initial offer. However, since the buyer's budget is a constraint, a moderate price between the two targets seems appropriate. Therefore, I predict the final price to be $2000, which is closer to the seller's counteroffer but still within the buyer's budget. However, given the constraints of the format, I will provide the final answer in the correct format.

This negotiation involves the sale of a Casio Ex Word Data Plus Japanese dictionary. The buyer inquires about the item's functionality and connectivity requirements. The seller provides information about the item's connectivity requirements and mentions that it comes with a USB cable. The buyer asks for additional details about the item, but no further information is provided. Given the limited information and the buyer's inquiry, it seems like the buyer is interested in purchasing the item but needs more details. Since no specific details about the condition, warranty, or additional features are provided, it's challenging to determine the exact value of the item. However, based on the given information, the buyer is willing to pay $45, and the seller is asking for $75. Considering the buyer's offer and the seller's asking price, a projected sale price lies between these two numbers. A reasonable estimate would be to find a midpoint between the buyer's and seller's targets. FINAL_PRICE: $60.0<|eot_id|>",45,75,50.0,60.0,0.1666666666666666,0.5,2.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing an iPhone from a seller. The buyer is motivated to make the purchase as a birthday gift for their son but is on a budget due to recent financial constraints. The seller is initially firm on the price but shows flexibility by offering a reduced price of $180. The buyer seems willing to negotiate further, but the conversation is cut short. Given this context, it seems like the buyer and seller are willing to negotiate, but the conversation does not provide enough details to predict the exact sale price. However, we can infer that the final price will likely be closer to the buyer's target due to the seller's willingness to negotiate and the buyer's financial constraints. Therefore, I predict the final sale price to be around $100, which is closer to the buyer's target. FINAL_PRICE: $100.0<|eot_id|>",100,200,150.0,100.0,0.5,0.0,16.666666666666668

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the availability and condition of a theatre system. The seller confirms the system's availability and provides details about its usage history, stating that it has been used briefly to test its functionality. The buyer does not express concern about the usage history, indicating that the system's condition is not a significant issue. Given this context, it seems that the buyer is interested in purchasing the theatre system. However, no specific price negotiation is initiated in the given conversation. Therefore, predicting the sale price requires making an educated guess based on the provided information. Since the buyer does not express concerns about the system's condition and the seller does not provide any significant discounts, a reasonable estimate for the sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Given the lack of specific price negotiation and no concerns expressed by the buyer, a fair estimate would be slightly lower than the seller's target, but not significantly lower than the buyer's target. Therefore, a projected sale price of $75 lies between the buyer and seller targets and seems like a reasonable estimate. FINAL_PRICE: $75.0<|eot_id|>",50,100,80.0,75.0,0.6,0.5,0.3125

This negotiation involves a seller offering a unit for rent at $2250 with the condition that the buyer moves in immediately and there is no deposit required. The buyer is interested in the deal and asks for confirmation. The seller reiterates the terms of the deal. The buyer seems to be pleased with the offer and does not negotiate further. Given the lack of negotiation and the buyer's acceptance of the terms, it is reasonable to assume that the buyer will accept the offer as is. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $2250.0<|eot_id|>",1575,2250,1925.0,2250.0,0.5185185185185185,1.0,54.87012987012987

This negotiation involves the sale of six phones with some damage. The seller is offering a good deal, including the phones and a T-Mobile phone, and is willing to deliver them. The buyer is concerned about the condition of the phones and is trying to negotiate the price. Given the buyer's concerns and the seller's willingness to negotiate, it is likely that the buyer will be able to get a good price. However, the buyer is only willing to pay $35, which is less than the seller's initial offer of $50. The seller may be willing to negotiate further, but the buyer's limit is quite low. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $40.0<|eot_id|>",35,50,35.0,40.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7142857142857143

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike from a seller. The buyer inquires about delivery options and the price of the bike. The seller confirms delivery is available and states the price as $600. The buyer does not immediately respond with an offer, indicating a need for further negotiation. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer will attempt to negotiate the price downward. However, the details provided do not offer clear intentions for the buyer's next move. Therefore, predicting the exact outcome is challenging. However, we can make an educated guess based on the given information. Since the buyer does not make an initial offer, it is likely that they will negotiate the price. Given that the buyer is interested in the bike, they may be willing to pay a price slightly lower than the asking price. A reasonable estimate for the projected sale price would be between the buyer's and seller's targets. Therefore, I predict that the projected sale price lies between $330 and $550.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in renting an apartment and inquiring about its features and parking availability. The seller provides detailed information about the apartment and clarifies the parking situation, assuring the buyer of its safety. Given the buyer's positive response to the apartment's features and the seller's assurance of safety, it is likely that the buyer will make an offer close to the seller's target. However, there is no explicit mention of the buyer's budget constraints or any counter-offers, so we cannot predict the exact final price.

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the completeness of the product and the seller reassuring the buyer about the product's functionality and completeness. The buyer seems to be concerned about the product's functionality and the seller provides assurance. There is no indication of a price negotiation in the given negotiation, so it's reasonable to assume that the sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Given the lack of price negotiation, I will choose the average of the buyer and seller targets as the projected sale price.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike from the seller. The buyer initially offers $600, which the seller finds too low. The seller justifies the value of the bike by mentioning it has touring tires. The buyer increases the offer to $650, asserting that this is a good price. The seller does not immediately respond to this new offer, indicating a need for further negotiation. Given the lack of a direct response, it is difficult to predict the exact outcome. However, considering the buyer's willingness to negotiate and the seller's justification of the bike's value, a projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. The buyer has already increased their offer from $600 to $650, which is closer to the seller's target of $800. Since the seller has not rejected the buyer's new offer, it is reasonable to assume that the sale price will be closer to the buyer's target. Therefore, a projected sale price lies between $480 and $800. FINAL_PRICE: $600.0<|eot_id|>",480,800,715.0,600.0,0.734375,0.375,18.496503496503497

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in a property and requesting more information about its condition and the neighborhood. The seller provides details about the property's recent remodeling and amenities. The buyer then inquires about the neighborhood. There is no direct negotiation on the price in the given conversation. However, given the context, it can be inferred that the buyer is interested in the property and is seeking more information to make a decision. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, indicating that the buyer is likely to offer a price between $1615 and $1795. Since the buyer has expressed interest and the seller has provided positive information about the property, it is reasonable to assume that the buyer will offer a price closer to the lower end of the range. Therefore, a projected sale price of $1650 is a reasonable estimate. FINAL_PRICE: $1650.0<|eot_id|>",1615,1795,1650.0,1650.0,0.1944444444444444,0.1944444444444444,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing an iPhone, and the seller is willing to negotiate the price. The buyer starts by inquiring about the price, and the seller responds with an initial offer of $350. The buyer expresses surprise and makes a counteroffer of $100, suggesting that their iPhone model might be different from the seller's. The seller acknowledges the buyer's concern and offers a new price of $300 while asking if the buyer wants more information about the phone. Given this context, it seems like the buyer and seller are engaged in a negotiation to agree on a suitable price for the iPhone. The buyer's initial offer of $100 is significantly lower than the seller's initial offer of $350, indicating a large gap between their desired prices. The seller's willingness to negotiate and provide more information suggests that they are open to finding a mutually acceptable price. However, the negotiation does not provide detailed information about the buyer's budget or specific needs, making it challenging to predict an exact sale price. Given the significant difference between the initial offers and the willingness to negotiate, a reasonable projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer's offer is much lower than the seller's initial offer, and the seller is willing to negotiate, it's likely that the final price will be closer to the buyer's offer. However, without more specific information about the buyer's budget or needs, predicting an exact sale price is challenging. Therefore, I will choose a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets but is closer to the buyer's offer.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the purchase of a car. The buyer expresses interest in the car and makes an initial offer of $10500. The seller highlights the car's quality and value, but does not directly respond to the offer. The buyer increases their offer to $11000, and the seller offers to provide more information about the car. The buyer agrees to hear more information. Given the lack of direct negotiation and the buyer's willingness to hear more information, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. However, considering the buyer's initial offer and the seller's emphasis on the car's quality, a projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer is willing to pay $11000 and the seller is asking $22000, a reasonable projected sale price would be between these two numbers.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a TV stand from the seller. The buyer inquires about the condition and capacity of the product, while the seller provides information and assures the buyer of the product's good condition. The buyer also asks about additional features, such as tie-downs or straps for holding the television in place. The negotiation is straightforward and focused on providing information about the product. Given this context, it is reasonable to predict that the sale price will be closer to the buyer's target. The seller's assurance of the product's good condition and estimated capacity may alleviate the buyer's concerns, potentially leading to a lower sale price. Therefore, I predict that the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a seller trying to persuade a buyer to purchase an item at a price of $250. The buyer is interested in the item but does not immediately agree to the price. The negotiation involves the seller providing more information about the item and the buyer inquiring about the item's origin. The buyer does not make a direct offer but seems to be considering the purchase. The seller is trying to build rapport and create an emotional connection to justify the price. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer will negotiate the price downward but still be willing to pay a premium for the item.

This negotiation involves the sale of a used phone. The buyer inquires about the condition and accessories included with the phone. The seller provides detailed information about the phone's condition and the accessories included. The buyer does not express any concerns or negotiate the price directly in this conversation. Given the lack of price negotiation, we can infer that the buyer is interested in the phone and may be willing to accept the seller's price. However, without explicit negotiation, it's difficult to predict the exact sale price. To make an educated prediction, we can consider the original price provided by the seller ($280) and the buyer's target ($168). A reasonable estimate lies between these numbers. Considering the buyer does not express any concerns and the seller provides detailed information, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets is $220.

Interpretation: In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in purchasing a TV and is on a budget of $200. The seller is asking for $575, which is significantly higher than the buyer's budget. The buyer expresses their budget constraint and the seller inquires about the buyer's budget. The negotiation is initiated to find a mutually acceptable price for the TV. Given the price gap and the buyer's budget constraint, there is room for negotiation. The seller may be willing to reduce the price to meet the buyer's budget.

Projection: Given the price gap and the buyer's budget constraint, a projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. The seller may be willing to negotiate the price to meet the buyer's budget of $200. A reasonable projected sale price would be $400, which is closer to the buyer's budget and still acceptable to the seller.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike for their 5-year-old son. The seller provides information about the bike's size and condition, assuring the buyer that the brakes are in good condition. The buyer expresses interest and asks for further details about the brakes. The seller confirms that the brakes are like new. There is no direct negotiation on the price in this conversation, but the buyer has expressed interest in purchasing the bike, indicating a potential willingness to pay the asking price. Given this context, a projected sale price between the buyer and seller targets is likely to be closer to the seller's target. However, since there is no direct negotiation, we cannot pinpoint the exact price. Therefore, I will provide a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a truck from a seller. The buyer expresses interest in the truck and inquires about its accident history. The seller provides information about the truck's maintenance and accident history, and clarifies the status of the check engine light. The buyer explains the intended use of the truck for their son's summer job and makes an initial offer of $3,100. The seller does not immediately respond to the offer, but it can be inferred that they are open to negotiation. Given the buyer's legitimate reason for purchasing the truck and the initial offer, a projected sale price between the buyer and seller targets seems reasonable. Therefore, the final answer is: FINAL_PRICE: $3200.0<|eot_id|>",3220,3500,3220.0,3200.0,0.0,-0.0714285714285714,0.124223602484472

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bed and a seller offering the bed for sale. The buyer expresses interest in the bed and asks about its condition. The seller provides information about the condition and usage of the bed. The buyer seems to be impressed with the bed and is likely to make an offer. Given the condition of the bed and the buyer's interest, a projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer is likely to make an offer, the projected sale price is expected to be lower than the seller's target. However, the buyer's offer is not explicitly stated in the negotiation, so we can't determine the exact amount they are willing to pay. Therefore, we can only provide a general estimate based on the given information. FINAL_PRICE: $200.0<|eot_id|>",171,225,180.0,200.0,0.1666666666666666,0.5370370370370371,2.2222222222222223

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a vintage desk from a seller. The buyer inquires about the condition of the desk and its drawers, which the seller assures is in good condition. The buyer expresses interest and asks for the price, to which the seller responds with the asking price of $60. The buyer does not immediately respond, indicating a need for further negotiation. The seller does not make any further offers or concessions, awaiting the buyer's response.

Given the lack of additional information or negotiation from the seller, and the buyer's silence, it is difficult to predict the projected sale price. However, since the buyer does not make any counteroffers and the seller does not make any concessions, it can be inferred that the buyer is interested in the item but may not be willing to pay the full price. A reasonable projection of the sale price would be somewhere between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between $36 and $60.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a Datsun car. The seller confirms the availability of the car and provides details about its condition and mileage. The buyer seeks clarification on the mileage and expresses concern about the originality of the mileage. The seller assures that the mileage is original and mentions additional work done on the car. The buyer acknowledges the work done and makes an initial offer of $1500. Given the details provided, the buyer is interested in the car but is making a lower offer. The seller has not shown any willingness to negotiate yet, but the buyer's offer is significantly lower than the listing price. A projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. I predict the final price to be around $2600. This is a reasonable offer given the car's condition and the buyer's initial offer.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing excitement and nervousness about purchasing a product, specifically an antenna with a fine tuning dial. The seller acknowledges and empathizes with the buyer's feelings. The buyer makes an initial offer of $5, which the seller counters with $10. The buyer seems to be interested in the product and is willing to negotiate the price. Given the buyer's enthusiasm and the seller's willingness to negotiate, it is likely that the final price will be closer to the buyer's target. However, the seller's initial counteroffer of $10 suggests that they are not willing to go much lower than their target price. Therefore, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets is $8.00. FINAL_PRICE: $8.0<|eot_id|>",7,12,10.0,8.0,0.6,0.2,0.4

Interpretation: In this negotiation, the seller is offering a car for sale and providing information about its condition and reason for selling. The buyer is inquiring about the car's mileage and accident history. There is no apparent issue with the car, and the buyer seems interested. The seller's reason for selling the car (an engagement gift) is a personal and non-financial reason, which might evoke sympathy from the buyer. The conversation is polite and friendly, indicating a potential for a successful sale. Since there are no financial details discussed, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. However, given the buyer's interest and the seller's willingness to provide information, a reasonable estimate lies between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, I predict that the sale price will be around the midpoint of the given targets. FINAL_PRICE: $4200.0<|eot_id|>",3420,4500,3500.0,4200.0,0.074074074074074,0.7222222222222222,140.0

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in a property and inquiring about its details. The seller provides some information but admits to not knowing the age of the property and offers a link for more information. The buyer expresses concern about the price and the seller justifies it by emphasizing the quality and condition of the property. The seller also offers a lower price. The buyer seeks clarification about a detail in the listing and the seller provides an explanation. Finally, the buyer expresses dissatisfaction with the amenities provided. The negotiation is ongoing but does not involve a clear offer and counteroffer. Given this information, it is difficult to predict the projected sale price accurately. However, the buyer seems interested in the property but is concerned about the price and amenities. The seller has shown some flexibility by offering a lower price. A possible projected sale price could be between the buyer and seller targets, but it is hard to determine without more information.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in renting a property but is restricted by a no-pet policy. The buyer is willing to accept the terms but proposes a lower price of $3100. Since the seller does not allow pets, the buyer's offer is not contingent on the pet policy. However, the buyer's willingness to accept the terms suggests that the price is the main point of negotiation. Given the buyer's limited flexibility and the seller's firm stance on the pet policy, it is likely that the seller will not accept the lower offer. A reasonable counteroffer from the seller could be expected. A suitable counteroffer could be $3250, which is $100 less than the original price but still within the range that the buyer might be willing to accept. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, but closer to the seller's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the availability and condition of stools for sale. The seller confirms the stools are still available and in good condition. The buyer asks for more details about the condition, and the seller assures them the stools are in like new condition. Given this information, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the seller has confirmed the good condition of the stools, the buyer is likely to offer a price closer to the seller's target. However, without more information about the buyer's budget or specific needs, it's difficult to determine the exact price.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a car listed by the seller. The seller provides detailed information about the car's condition and specifications. The buyer requests a test drive and expresses interest in the car. The seller agrees to the test drive but emphasizes the urgency to sell the car. Given the buyer's interest and the seller's urgency, it is likely that the negotiation will result in a sale. However, the buyer has not made an initial offer, and the seller has not shown significant flexibility in the price. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer has not made an offer and the seller has not shown flexibility, we can assume the sale price will be closer to the seller's target.

Predict: [Predict the final sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets: Given the buyer's target of $315 and the seller's target of $450, a reasonable offer that lies between these targets would be around $400.

Projected Sale Price: $26500.0
Interpretation: The buyer is interested in the car and asks questions about its condition and usage. The seller provides detailed information about the car's mileage, ownership, and maintenance. The buyer inquires about the reason for selling the car, indicating a desire to understand the context. The negotiation is friendly and informative, with the buyer showing interest in the car. Since the buyer does not make an offer, we can predict the sale price to be the lowest target of $26500.0.<|eot_id|>",26500,53000,50000.0,26500.0,0.8867924528301887,0.0,11045.0

Interpretation: The buyer is interested in the phone flashing service but faces financial constraints due to the cost of diapers. The seller is willing to negotiate the price, offering $40. The buyer seems open to this but also mentions that they need to buy diapers, indicating that their financial situation is a priority. The seller's offer of $40 is a good starting point, but the buyer's concern about diapers suggests that they might not be able to afford it. The buyer could potentially offer a lower price, but it's unclear at this point. Given the context, it seems that the seller is willing to negotiate, and the buyer is trying to find a solution that works for both parties. However, without more information about the buyer's exact financial situation and the seller's flexibility, predicting the exact price is challenging. Since the buyer has a budget constraint and is seeking a deal, it's reasonable to assume that they would like to pay as little as possible while the seller is willing to negotiate but seems to have a minimum price in mind. Given these dynamics, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets is reasonable. FINAL_PRICE: $35.0<|eot_id|>",25,50,26.0,35.0,0.04,0.4,3.1153846153846154

In this negotiation, the seller is initially offering the sub box for $50 and is willing to negotiate. The buyer makes an initial offer of $25, which the seller rejects and counters with $45. The buyer then offers $20, which the seller rejects and states that the last they can do is $40. The buyer does not respond to the seller's last offer, indicating that they are not willing to pay $40. The seller does not make any further concessions, indicating that they are not willing to negotiate further. Given this information, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, and it seems that the seller is not willing to go any lower than $40.

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the features of a square speaker and challenging the seller's asking price of $20, which is significantly higher than the listed price of $20. The seller lists the features of the speaker but does not provide any additional offers. The buyer is trying to negotiate a lower price, but the seller is not willing to budge. Given the information provided, it appears that the buyer is not interested in paying the full price and is trying to negotiate a deal. However, the seller is not willing to make any concessions. Therefore, it is likely that the negotiation will not result in a sale. However, the final price is not provided in the given negotiation, so I will predict a price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in a service that can unblock them from T-mobile. The seller confirms that they can provide this service. The buyer seems to be satisfied with the service capability and does not express any concerns or objections. Since there is no negotiation on the price, it is likely that the buyer is willing to accept the original price. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a car and a seller providing information about the car's maintenance and condition. The buyer is seeking confirmation about the absence of mechanical issues and the seller is reassuring them. The negotiation is straightforward and focused on providing information and answering questions. There is no indication of a strong negotiation or a need to make a counteroffer. Given the lack of complexity and the positive tone of the negotiation, it is reasonable to predict that the sale price will be closer to the seller's target. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be around the seller's target of $10500. FINAL_PRICE: $10500.0<|eot_id|>",5250,10500,6500.0,10500.0,0.23809523809523808,1.0,2461.5384615384614

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a BMW from the seller. The buyer expresses concern about the high mileage and negotiates the price down to $4200. The seller explains the reason for the high mileage and counters with a higher price of $6000. The buyer compliments the car's features and makes a counteroffer of $5200, also requesting free shipping. Given this information, it appears that the buyer is willing to negotiate and make an offer, but the seller is not willing to budge much on the price. The buyer is willing to go up to $5200, which is still lower than the seller's offer of $6000. However, the buyer's willingness to negotiate and the seller's relatively firm stance suggest that there is some room for negotiation. Considering the buyer's offer and the seller's counteroffer, a reasonable projected sale price lies between $5200 and $6000. Given the context and intentions, I predict that the projected sale price will be closer to the buyer's offer, but still slightly higher than their target.

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the purchase of a car. The buyer is concerned about the car being driven long distances, but the seller provides context to alleviate this concern by mentioning that they only drive the car to Canada twice a year. The seller seems to be open to negotiation as they initiate the conversation and provide additional information to address the buyer's concerns. The buyer, however, does not make a specific offer or proposal in the negotiation. Given the context and intentions, it appears that the seller is willing to negotiate, but the buyer does not take the initiative to do so. Therefore, it is difficult to predict a specific sale price. However, considering the initial targets and the context, a reasonable projection lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in renting a partially furnished unit with beautiful views of the bay. The seller provides detailed information about the location, including its proximity to shopping areas and natural surroundings. The buyer expresses interest but mentions that the price is holding them back. The seller does not respond to the buyer's concern about the price. Given this, it seems like the negotiation is incomplete and the buyer is waiting for the seller to address their concern. However, since the seller does not respond, it's difficult to predict the final sale price. But given the buyer's interest and the lack of a response from the seller, it's possible that the buyer might be willing to negotiate the price. Since the buyer is the one who initiated the conversation and expressed interest, they might be willing to make an offer. However, without more information about the buyer's budget or the seller's willingness to negotiate, it's difficult to predict the final sale price. Given the lack of response from the seller and the buyer's concern about the price, it seems like the negotiation is incomplete. However, if I had to make an educated guess, I would say that the buyer might be willing to pay around $2250, which is closer to their target but still a bit lower than the seller's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a product from the seller. The buyer inquires about the duration of ownership and the availability of the original box, indicating a concern for the item's condition and completeness. The seller assures the buyer of the item's condition and confirms the availability of the original packing supplies. The buyer then makes an offer of $87, which is lower than the seller's target price of $175. However, the seller does not immediately reject the offer, suggesting that there is room for negotiation. Given the context, it seems likely that the buyer and seller can come to a mutually agreeable price between $87 and $175. Therefore, I predict the projected sale price to be $150.0.

This negotiation is a straightforward inquiry about the condition and safety of the apartments being sold. The buyer is interested in purchasing the apartments and wants to ensure they are suitable for their family. The seller provides positive information about the condition and safety of the apartments, which suggests that they are in good condition and suitable for families. Given this context, it seems like the buyer is likely to make an offer that is close to the seller's target price. However, there is no direct negotiation of the price in the given conversation, so we can only assume that the buyer is interested and willing to pay a reasonable price. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be somewhere between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a Prius from a seller. The buyer inquires about the advanced package and the car's service history. The seller provides detailed information about the advanced package and reassures the buyer about the car's condition and service history. The negotiation is polite and informative, indicating a strong interest in the car from the buyer. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer will make an offer close to the seller's target. However, the buyer's question about the car's service history suggests they are being cautious and may try to negotiate a lower price. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be lower than the seller's target but higher than the buyer's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in renting a pet-friendly apartment. The seller provides information about the deposit and utilities.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a Pioneer stereo system. The seller provides positive information about the item's condition and quality, but the buyer seeks more specific details about the sound quality. The negotiation is straightforward and focuses on the item's condition and quality. Given the lack of price negotiation and the seller's positive description, it is likely that the buyer will accept the original price. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $150.0<|eot_id|>",120,200,175.0,150.0,0.6875,0.375,3.5714285714285716

Projecting the sale price for the negotiation, I can see that the buyer is somewhat interested in the item but is not very enthusiastic. The seller is willing to negotiate but wants to ensure the buyer is willing to pick up the item. Given the lack of strong interest and the fact that the buyer is willing to pick up the item, I predict the sale price will be lower than the seller's target. However, the buyer is willing to negotiate, so I'll try to find a middle ground. The initial offer of $140 seems reasonable, but I think the seller might be willing to come down a bit further. I'll predict a sale price of $140. FINAL_PRICE: $140.0<|eot_id|>",138,150,140.0,140.0,0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the sale of a chair and ottoman. The buyer is interested in purchasing the items but is concerned about the condition due to the presence of scratches and wear and tear. The seller provides detailed information about the condition and the buyer then negotiates a lower price. Given this context, it seems like the buyer is willing to make an offer and the seller is willing to accept it, but there is no clear indication of the exact amount the buyer is willing to pay. However, the buyer is willing to pay less than the original price of $50, and the seller is willing to negotiate, indicating a willingness to accept a lower price. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be somewhere between the buyer and seller targets. The final answer is: FINAL_PRICE: $30.0<|eot_id|>",25,50,35.0,30.0,0.4,0.2,0.7142857142857143

Projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. The seller initially sets a price of $1950 and the buyer offers $1200, indicating a significant gap. The seller justifies the value of the apartment by highlighting its amenities. The buyer expresses concerns about specific amenities and location but indicates slight flexibility in budget. The seller offers to pay the bills for the buyer as an additional incentive. Given this information, it seems the seller is willing to negotiate, but the buyer's budget is still a significant constraint. The final offer of $1200 is likely too low for the seller, but the seller's willingness to negotiate suggests there is some room for compromise. A projected sale price of $1650 lies between the buyer and seller targets and takes into account the seller's incentives and the buyer's budget constraints.

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the lease duration and expressing concern about the price of the rental property. The seller justifies the price by highlighting the new and desirable features of the property. The buyer makes a specific offer of $1735, which is lower than the seller's initial price. The seller shows limited willingness to negotiate but is open to slight negotiations. Given this information, it is likely that the buyer and seller will come to a mutually agreeable price, but it will be closer to the buyer's offer. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $1950.0<|eot_id|>",1732,2279,2195.0,1950.0,0.8464351005484461,0.39853747714808047,27.34624145785877

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in purchasing the bike mount from the seller. The buyer starts by inquiring about the condition of the bike mount and then makes an initial offer to purchase it for $7. The seller provides information about the condition and duration of ownership, indicating that the bike mount is in great condition and has been used only a few times. The seller does not immediately accept the buyer's offer but does not provide any counteroffer either. Given the information provided, it seems like the seller is willing to negotiate but hasn't made any counteroffer yet. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the projected sale price without more information. However, based on the fact that the seller is willing to negotiate and the bike mount is in great condition, I would suggest a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. Given this, I predict that the projected sale price lies between $9 and $15. I would suggest a final price of $12, which is slightly above the buyer's initial offer but still reasonable given the condition and duration of ownership of the bike mount.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a house and a seller who is willing to provide information about the property. The buyer expresses concern about the pricing and inquires about the possibility of negotiating the price. The seller does not directly respond to the question about negotiation, but the conversation suggests that the buyer is interested in the property and is willing to negotiate the price. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer and seller will engage in price negotiation. However, without further details about the buyer's budget or the seller's flexibility, it is difficult to predict the exact price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, I will make an educated guess based on the information provided.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in a one-bedroom apartment for $2070 per month. The seller provides information about the apartment's features and clarifies it is not furnished. The buyer inquires about the deposit and negotiates by comparing with other similar options. Given the buyer's offer of $1600, which is lower than the listed price, the seller can justify the higher price due to the apartment's new renovated kitchen. However, the buyer's offer is still lower than the seller's target, indicating a need for further negotiation. The seller could potentially accept a lower price, given the buyer's comparison with other similar options. A reasonable negotiation could result in a price between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, I predict the projected sale price to be $1900.0. FINAL_PRICE: $1900.0<|eot_id|>",1863,2070,1900.0,1900.0,0.178743961352657,0.178743961352657,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price of a display item. The buyer expresses interest in the item but feels the price is too high. The seller provides additional information about the item's features, but does not negotiate the price directly. The buyer attempts to initiate a price negotiation by stating they cannot afford the current price, but the seller does not respond with a counteroffer. Given this lack of direct negotiation, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. However, since the buyer expressed interest in the item and the seller provided additional information, it is possible that the buyer may be willing to pay a slightly lower price.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the price of a product, specifically phone batteries. The buyer expresses interest in purchasing the product, and the seller provides the price information. The buyer then negotiates the price, proposing $6.5, which the seller counters with $8. The buyer continues to negotiate, offering $7. The negotiation seems to be heading towards a mutually acceptable price, but it is not yet concluded. Given the context and intentions, it appears that the buyer and seller are close to agreeing on a price. Since the seller has already reduced the price from $10 to $8 and the buyer is offering $7, it seems reasonable to assume that they can reach a middle ground.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike and a seller who is willing to negotiate the price. The buyer expresses budget constraints and is unable to afford the asking price of $250. The seller makes a counteroffer of $235 and highlights the additional value of the headset included. The negotiation is focused on reaching a mutually agreeable price for the bike. Given this context, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. The buyer is willing to negotiate and is unable to afford the asking price, indicating that the seller may need to make a further concession. The seller has already made a slight concession from $250 to $235, suggesting that they are willing to negotiate. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the buyer's target of $125, but still higher than the buyer's budget. A reasonable projection would be $150.

This negotiation involves a Buyer interested in purchasing a Black sofa set from a Seller. The Buyer requests detailed condition information and expresses concern about the cost due to the need for cleaning and repairs. The Seller provides condition details and indicates willingness to negotiate the price. The Buyer negotiates the price, offering to come down on the price considering the additional expenses for repairs and cleaning. The Seller agrees to come down on the price, but the exact amount is not specified. Given this context, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. The Buyer is willing to pay $1260, and the Seller is willing to sell for $1800. The negotiation suggests that the Buyer is willing to negotiate further, but the final agreed-upon price is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the Buyer's target. However, it is also possible that the Seller could accept a higher offer, given their initial willingness to negotiate. A reasonable projection would be to consider the middle ground between the two targets, taking into account the Buyer's willingness to negotiate and the Seller's initial flexibility.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a Blu RD H1 cell phone from a seller. The seller provides detailed information about the phone's specifications, including its storage capacity, RAM, and processor. The buyer inquires about the phone's age and the seller responds, explaining that the phone is only three months old and has been well taken care of. The seller also mentions that they are selling the phone because they have decided to switch to an iPhone due to work requirements. The buyer does not make any specific offers or counteroffers, but the negotiation appears to be progressing smoothly. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer and seller are negotiating a fair price for the phone. However, without more information about the buyer's budget or the seller's willingness to negotiate, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. Therefore, I will make an educated guess based on the provided information. Given the phone's relatively new condition and the seller's willingness to provide detailed information, I predict a sale price of $45, which lies between the buyer and seller targets.

In this negotiation, the buyer shows genuine interest in the bike and asks specific questions about its condition. The seller provides detailed information about the bike's condition, which is positive and reassuring. The buyer then expresses approval and makes a cash offer of $700, which is higher than the seller's initial price of $675 but lower than the listed price of $1350. The seller has not yet responded to the offer, so it's unclear if they are willing to accept it. However, given the buyer's enthusiasm and the positive condition of the bike, it's likely that the seller will accept the offer. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $700.0<|eot_id|>",675,1350,1000.0,700.0,0.48148148148148145,0.037037037037037035,90.0

The buyer seems to be interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. Given the lack of specific details about the dimensions, it's likely that the buyer is trying to gauge the price. The seller's response suggests that the bed frame is a good quality product, which could justify a higher price. However, the buyer is not yet willing to commit to the higher price of $150. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, indicating that the negotiation is still in progress. Given the context, I predict the projected sale price to be around $125. However, since the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets and the buyer is not yet willing to commit to the higher price, I will adjust my prediction to be slightly lower than the seller's target. Therefore, the projected sale price is $130. However, since the buyer is interested and the seller is providing a good quality product, I will adjust my prediction to be slightly higher than the buyer's target. Therefore, the projected sale price is $125. Since the buyer is interested and the seller is providing a good quality product, I will adjust my prediction to be slightly higher than the buyer's target. Therefore, the projected sale price is $125. FINAL_PRICE: $125.0<|eot_id|>",114,150,114.0,125.0,0.0,0.3055555555555556,1.0614035087719298

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price of a MicroSD Card. The buyer makes an initial offer of $65, justifying it by stating that there are larger ones for the same price and feels it is fair. The seller counters by stating that they have seen similar cards sell for $85 in other places, but also acknowledges the convenience of pickup. The buyer reiterates the fairness of the offer and the convenience of pickup. Given this information, we can predict the projected sale price. The seller is trying to negotiate a higher price, but the buyer is firm on their offer. The seller seems to be open to negotiation, but the buyer is not willing to go above their initial offer. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $72.0<|eot_id|>",69,75,70.0,72.0,0.16666666666666666,0.5,0.05714285714285714

This negotiation is a straightforward inquiry about purchasing a laptop. The seller is willing to negotiate and is open to discussing the price. The buyer is looking for a good deal and is interested in purchasing the laptop. The conversation is brief and to the point, with no major obstacles or conflicts. Given the lack of information about the laptop's condition and specifications, it's difficult to determine a specific projected sale price. However, since the buyer is looking for a good deal and the seller is open to negotiating, it's likely that the sale price will be closer to the buyer's target. Therefore, I predict a projected sale price of $228, which lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $228.0<|eot_id|>",228,300,250.0,228.0,0.3055555555555556,0.0,1.936

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the condition and additional items included with a used phone for sale. The seller provides detailed information about the phone's condition, specifications, and the status of its contract. The buyer is concerned about the phone's contract status and the condition of the case. The seller offers to provide a case and screen protection for an additional cost. The negotiation is friendly and informative, with both parties providing relevant details about the phone. Given the details provided, it seems like the buyer is interested in the phone but wants to clarify some details before making a purchase. The seller is willing to provide additional items for an extra cost, which could be a selling point. However, the buyer is still cautious about the phone's condition and contract status. The negotiation is ongoing, but the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer is interested in the phone but wants to clarify details, and the seller is willing to provide additional items for an extra cost, it is likely that the buyer will make an offer lower than the seller's target. However, the seller's willingness to provide additional items suggests that the buyer may be able to negotiate a lower price. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, but it is likely closer to the buyer's target.

In this negotiation, the seller is attempting to justify the price of the iPad 2 by comparing it to the price of a new one. The buyer is expressing disagreement with the price and seeking clarification on the condition of the iPad. The seller is trying to establish a high value for the product. Given the context, it seems like the buyer is willing to negotiate, but the seller is firm on the price. A projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Since the seller is firm on the price and the buyer is trying to negotiate, the projected sale price should be closer to the seller's target. However, the buyer is not willing to pay the full price, so the projected sale price should be lower than the seller's target. Therefore, the projected sale price should be between $122 and $175.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the price of an apartment. The buyer initially expresses interest in the apartment but is concerned about the listed price being higher than they were willing to pay. The seller justifies the price by stating that it's a premium apartment, but is open to negotiating. The buyer counter-offers with a price of $2000, which is higher than their initial offer but still lower than the seller's asking price. Given this information, we can predict the projected sale price. The seller is unwilling to go as low as $1500 but is willing to negotiate. The buyer is willing to pay $2000, which is a reasonable offer given the apartment's premium status. The seller is willing to negotiate, so it's likely that the price can be settled somewhere between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between $1680 and $2800.

This negotiation involves a buyer expressing interest in a rental property and inquiring about its features. The seller provides detailed information about the room options, amenities, and the benefits of the place. The buyer shows enthusiasm for a specific room option. The negotiation seems to be going well, with the buyer interested in the property and the seller providing valuable information. Given this context, it seems likely that the negotiation will result in a sale. However, there is no direct mention of pricing, so it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. To make a prediction, I will consider the context and the fact that the buyer is interested in the property. I will also consider the fact that the seller is providing detailed information and seems to be enthusiastic about the property. Given these factors, I predict a sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $1500.0<|eot_id|>",930,1861,1600.0,1500.0,0.719656283566058,0.6122448979591837,6.25

This negotiation is about the buyer expressing interest in renting an apartment and inquiring about the deposit and utilities. The buyer also hopes to negotiate the price, citing financial constraints. The seller provides information about the deposit and utilities, but does not explicitly state their willingness to negotiate the price. However, the buyer is able to establish a rapport and express their needs, which may lead to a successful negotiation. Given this context, it is likely that the seller will be willing to negotiate the price, but the exact amount is not specified. Therefore, I predict the projected sale price to be $2450, which is a reasonable midpoint between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price of a phone unlocking service. The buyer initiates the conversation and expresses their intention to unlock their phone. The seller informs the buyer about the product and its price. The buyer then negotiates the price by offering a lower amount. The seller does not respond to the negotiation, indicating that the negotiation is incomplete. However, based on the given information, it seems that the seller is willing to accept a lower price, so a reasonable projection would be to offer a price that lies between the buyer and seller targets. Given the context, a fair price would be around $30.

In this negotiation, the buyer expresses interest in the table and proposes a condition for purchase (delivery). The seller acknowledges the proposal and seeks clarification on the distance involved for potential delivery. The buyer provides specific information about the distance from the seller's location. Given the context, it seems like the buyer is willing to pay full price if the seller agrees to deliver the table. However, the seller hasn't explicitly agreed to the delivery yet. The negotiation is ongoing, and more details are needed to determine the projected sale price. Since the buyer is willing to pay full price for delivery, and the seller hasn't yet agreed to the delivery, it is likely that the projected sale price will be closer to the seller's target. However, without more information about the seller's willingness to deliver or any further negotiations, it is difficult to determine the exact projected sale price. I will assume the buyer's willingness to pay full price as a strong indicator of the projected sale price. Therefore, I predict the projected sale price to be closer to the seller's target of $100.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike from a seller. The buyer inquires about the bike's condition, color, and usage, indicating a desire for more detailed information before making a purchase. The seller provides a positive response, stating that the bike has no dings or scratches and has only been ridden once. This establishes a positive tone and builds trust with the buyer. Given the bike's good condition and the buyer's interest, a reasonable negotiation is likely to occur. Since the buyer is interested in the bike and the seller is willing to sell it, a fair price can be expected. However, the buyer does not make an initial offer, so the negotiation is incomplete. To predict the projected sale price, I will make an educated guess based on the given information. Given the bike's good condition and the buyer's interest, a fair price lies between the buyer and seller targets. I will choose a price that is slightly lower than the seller's target but higher than the buyer's target. FINAL_PRICE: $190.0<|eot_id|>",180,200,180.0,190.0,0.0,0.5,0.5555555555555556

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a brand new iWave speaker from a seller. The buyer initially confirms the price of $20 and then inquires about the product's condition and negotiates the price. The seller confirms the product's condition and shows slight willingness to negotiate, but also expresses reluctance to go much lower than the original price. The buyer then makes a low offer of $10 and proposes immediate pickup. Given this information, it appears that the buyer is trying to get a good deal on the product, while the seller is trying to maintain the original price. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. The buyer is willing to pay $10, which is lower than the seller's target of $20, but the seller is also willing to negotiate, indicating that they might be open to a lower price. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be around $15. However, the seller's reluctance to go lower than $20 suggests that they might not be willing to accept the buyer's offer. Given this, a more reasonable projection would be $17, which is a compromise between the buyer's and seller's targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer inquiring about the availability of an iPhone for sale and the seller confirming its availability. The buyer then attempts to negotiate the price by mentioning that the model is older, but the seller does not respond to this negotiation attempt. Since the seller does not engage in the price negotiation, we can assume that the buyer's attempt to negotiate the price is not successful.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a Nissan from the seller. The seller explains that they are selling the car due to their family's growing needs and assures the buyer that the car is in good condition with no repairs needed. The buyer compliments the car and makes an initial offer of $5600.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the purchase of a truck. The buyer initiates the conversation and expresses interest in buying the truck. The seller encourages the buyer to make an offer and the buyer proposes an initial offer of $2000. The seller rejects the initial offer and asks the buyer to increase it. This indicates that the seller is willing to negotiate but wants a higher price. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer will increase their offer. Since the seller is asking the buyer to come up a bit, the buyer may be willing to meet the seller's price or come close to it. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $3000.0<|eot_id|>",2100,3500,3000.0,3000.0,0.6428571428571429,0.6428571428571429,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a bike from a seller. The seller is offering an amazing deal but the buyer immediately points out a potential issue with the product, specifically the need for a new inner tube. This suggests that the buyer is cautious and concerned about the condition of the bike. The seller's offer of a deal and invitation to ask questions indicates a willingness to negotiate and provide more information. However, the buyer's immediate concern about the bike's condition may lead to a lower offer or a request for a discount. Given the context, it seems unlikely that the buyer will accept the original price of $100. The projected sale price is likely to be lower, closer to the buyer's target of $60. However, the seller's willingness to negotiate and provide information suggests that there may be room for a compromise. The final price may be closer to $80, which is a reasonable middle ground between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be around $80.

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price of a used item. The buyer initially proposes a lower price of half the original price, which is $300. The seller counters with a higher price of $400, justifying it by stating the item is in excellent condition. The buyer then offers a new price of $300, arguing that the item is not the newest model and the half of the original price seems fair for used. The seller does not respond to the new offer, so it can be assumed that the negotiation has reached an impasse. Given the information provided, it is difficult to predict the projected sale price accurately. However, considering the initial offers and the justifications provided, it seems that the seller is unwilling to go below $400. The buyer's final offer of $300 is a reasonable and fair price given the item is used, but the seller does not respond to this offer. Therefore, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets can be estimated as $350, which is closer to the seller's target but still lower than the seller's counteroffer.

In this negotiation, the buyer shows genuine interest in the product and inquires about the price flexibility. The seller is willing to negotiate and provides additional details about the product. The buyer makes an initial offer of $75 cash and proposes alternative payment options. Given this context, it seems like both parties are open to negotiation and willing to find a mutually acceptable price. The buyer's offer of $75 is a reasonable starting point, and the seller's initial price of $150 is somewhat high. However, the seller is willing to negotiate, indicating that they may be willing to come down from the original price. The buyer's offer of $75 is a good starting point, and the seller may be willing to accept it or negotiate further. Therefore, I predict that the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $125.0<|eot_id|>",75,150,100.0,125.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,6.25

Given the positive tone and the seller's willingness to offer additional value (new seat covers), it is likely that the buyer and seller can come to a mutually agreeable price. The buyer is showing genuine interest and the seller is providing detailed information, which suggests a smooth negotiation. However, without more information about the buyer's budget or the seller's minimum acceptable price, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. Given the context, it seems that the buyer and seller are on a good footing, and the seller's offer of additional value suggests a willingness to compromise. Therefore, a projected sale price of $8500 seems reasonable, which is slightly lower than the seller's target but still within a reasonable range.

Projected sale price lies between $607 and $675. The seller is firm on the price but willing to trade, and the buyer is willing to negotiate the price. In this case, the buyer is trying to lower the price to $600, which is below the seller's target but still close to it. Given the buyer's offer and the seller's firmness, a reasonable projection would be to round down from the seller's target.

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in purchasing the car and is inquiring about its condition. The seller is providing detailed information about the car's condition and reason for selling. The buyer is seeking confirmation about the interior and paint condition. The seller assures that everything is in good shape. The negotiation is straightforward and informative, with the buyer seeking specific details about the car. Given this context, it seems that the buyer is interested in the car and is willing to negotiate the price. The seller is providing accurate information about the car's condition, which suggests that they are willing to negotiate as well. However, the projected sale price is not explicitly mentioned in the negotiation. Therefore, I will make an educated guess based on the provided information. Given that the car is 12 years old and has 149,500 miles on it, it is likely that the price is slightly lower than the seller's target of $5800. However, the buyer's target of $4408 is also lower than the seller's target. Considering the age and mileage of the car, I would estimate the projected sale price to be around $5200, which is closer to the seller's target but lower than the buyer's target. Therefore, the final answer is: FINAL_PRICE: 5200.0<|eot_id|>",4408,5800,4850.0,5200.0,0.3175287356321839,0.5689655172413793,25.257731958762886

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a sofa from a seller who is moving and doesn't want to transport it. The buyer inquires about the condition of the sofa, specifically asking about tears to the leather and pet stains. The seller provides detailed information about the condition, including a small 2-inch tear in the back of the chair that can easily be repaired. They also mention that the sofa is in great condition and very high quality leather. The buyer seems satisfied with the information and is likely to proceed with the purchase. Given the positive conversation and the detailed information provided by the seller, the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the buyer's target of $495. However, the seller's target of $550 is slightly higher, indicating that they are willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, and a reasonable final price would be around $495.

The seller confirms the item's good condition and the buyer seeks further confirmation about a specific part (the mount). The buyer then attempts to negotiate the price, asking if the seller would be willing to come down on the price and inquiring about the seller's comfort level with a lower offer.

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in the apartment in Richmond and is inquiring about the location. The seller assures the buyer that the apartment is in a nice area, within walking distance to Bart. The buyer then expresses interest in negotiating the price, indicating that it is a bit too high for them. This suggests that the buyer is willing to make an offer, but is seeking a discount. Given this context, it is likely that the buyer will propose a lower price than the seller's initial asking price. However, the seller has not yet provided any indication of being willing to negotiate. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price, but it is likely to be lower than the seller's initial asking price. Given the buyer's interest in negotiating, a reasonable projected sale price would be $1415, which is $180 lower than the seller's initial asking price.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a used Fender amp. The seller provides information about the amp's age and condition, and the buyer asks for confirmation on the amp's functionality. The seller confirms that the amp works perfectly and offers to include an amplifier cord. The buyer does not make a counteroffer but does not express interest in the product. Given this information, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. However, since the buyer does not express interest in the product, it is likely that the sale price will be closer to the seller's target. Therefore, I predict the projected sale price to be $40.0, which is closer to the seller's target. FINAL_PRICE: $40.0<|eot_id|>",27,45,40.0,40.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7222222222222222,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing a house for sale. The buyer expresses strong interest in the house and asks for information about its unique features. The seller provides detailed information about the house's features, including its location, layout, and amenities. The buyer seems to be impressed by the seller's description and is likely considering making an offer. Given the buyer's strong interest and the seller's positive description, it is likely that the buyer will make a serious offer. However, the negotiation does not provide specific details about the buyer's budget or the seller's minimum price, so it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. Based on the information provided, it seems that the buyer is willing to pay a significant amount for the house, but the seller's minimum price is not specified. Therefore, I will predict a sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets but is closer to the buyer's target.

In this negotiation, the seller is offering a 13-month lease with a discounted monthly payment of $2700 and additional benefits such as free high-speed internet and free yoga. The buyer is interested in the property and asks for more details about the unit, including whether it comes with appliances. The seller confirms that the unit comes with all appliances and offers to waive the entire deposit if the buyer signs the lease before close. This is a strong incentive that could sway the buyer into making a decision. Given the benefits and the incentive, it's likely that the buyer will accept the offer and sign the lease. However, the buyer does not make any immediate commitment, so the negotiation is still ongoing. Since the buyer does not make any counteroffer, it is likely that the final price will be closer to the seller's target. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in renting an apartment and a seller providing detailed information about the apartment's furnishings and utilities. The buyer inquires about specific details, such as the inclusion of utilities and the type of water supply. The negotiation is straightforward and focused on clarifying the details of the apartment. Given the detailed nature of the conversation and the lack of price negotiation, it appears that the buyer is interested in the apartment and the seller is providing information to address the buyer's concerns. However, there is no direct negotiation of the price, and the conversation does not indicate any significant bargaining. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be close to the seller's target, but it is also reasonable to consider the buyer's target as the negotiation does not indicate a strong intent to pay more than the seller's target. Since the buyer and seller have a positive conversation, it is likely that they will come to a mutually agreeable price. Given the lack of price negotiation, the projected sale price is likely to be between the buyer and seller targets. However, considering the detailed information provided by the seller and the lack of negotiation, it seems reasonable to lean towards the seller's target.

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in purchasing the item but is concerned about the price. The seller justifies the price as reasonable but the buyer is still unwilling to pay the full amount. The buyer asks if there are any extras that can be thrown in if they pay the full price, indicating a willingness to negotiate further. Given this context, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. The buyer is willing to pay $190, which is less than the seller's target of $380. However, the seller is unwilling to accept the low offer and is willing to negotiate. Therefore, a projected sale price that lies between the two targets is likely. The seller mentions that the item is brand new in box still, which suggests that it is a valuable item. The buyer is interested in paying the full price if they can get some extras, which indicates a willingness to pay a higher price. Considering these points, a projected sale price that lies between $190 and $380 is likely. Given the context and intentions, I predict the projected sale price to be $320.0.

The seller provides assurance that the home is smoke-free and that pets have not peed on the table, but mentions that there is a small broken corner.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the price of a truck. The buyer starts by expressing admiration for the item, to which the seller agrees. The buyer then initiates a price negotiation by offering $8000, which the seller rejects as too low. The buyer increases the offer to $8200, but still expresses a lack of strong need for the item. Given this context, it appears that the buyer is willing to negotiate, but is not desperate for the item. The seller's rejection of the initial offer and the buyer's lack of strong need suggest that the buyer may not be willing to pay a high price. Therefore, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets is likely. I predict the projected sale price to be $11000.0.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a brand new, never used phone from a seller. The buyer is seeking assurance about the product's condition and compatibility with phone services. The seller provides assurance and confirms compatibility. The buyer then makes an initial offer of $540, which is close to the seller's target of $780. Given the buyer's interest and the seller's assurance, it's likely that the buyer will negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, the negotiation does not reveal any significant issues with the product or the buyer's willingness to pay a lower price. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $700.0<|eot_id|>",546,780,740.0,700.0,0.8290598290598291,0.6581196581196581,2.1621621621621623

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a car, and a seller who is willing to provide information about the car's condition and features. The buyer asks specific questions about the car's smoking history and media capabilities. The seller provides reassuring answers to these questions. The negotiation is friendly and informative, with no indication of conflict or disagreement.

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in purchasing a set of subs and inquires about their quality and installation requirements. The seller provides positive feedback on the product's quality and reassures the buyer that the product meets their needs. The buyer then makes a purchase offer of $152, which the seller rejects. The negotiation is straightforward, and both parties are clear about their intentions and requirements. However, the buyer's offer is rejected, indicating that the seller is not willing to accept it. Given this information, it is likely that the seller is seeking a higher price, and the buyer is willing to negotiate. To predict the projected sale price, we can analyze the intentions and offers made by both parties. The buyer's offer of $152 is rejected, and the seller does not provide a counteroffer. This suggests that the seller is seeking a higher price, but the exact amount is not specified. Given the context and the lack of a counteroffer, it is reasonable to assume that the seller is seeking a price higher than $152 but lower than $200, which is the seller's target. Therefore, a projected sale price of $180 lies between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $180.0<|eot_id|>",152,200,180.0,180.0,0.5833333333333334,0.5833333333333334,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price of a used item. The buyer expresses interest but is concerned about the high price, and the seller justifies the price by emphasizing the quality of the item. The buyer then asks about the condition of the tires, and the seller assures them they are in great condition. The buyer makes a counteroffer of $180, and the seller responds with a slightly lower offer of $190. Given this information, it seems like the buyer and seller are close to reaching an agreement, but the seller is still trying to negotiate a higher price.

This negotiation is about purchasing a bike. The buyer is interested in the bike and asks questions about its comfort and appearance. The seller provides information about the bike's seat and its recent replacement. The buyer seems to be satisfied with the information and is likely interested in making an offer. However, there is no direct mention of a price or an offer from the buyer in the given negotiation. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the projected sale price accurately. Given the context and the fact that the seller is providing positive information about the bike, I will assume that the buyer is interested in purchasing the bike and will make an offer close to the seller's target. However, since the buyer's target is lower than the seller's target, I will assume that the buyer is willing to negotiate and make a lower offer. Since the negotiation is incomplete, I will make an educated guess based on the context. FINAL_PRICE: $450.0<|eot_id|>",380,500,380.0,450.0,0.0,0.5833333333333334,12.894736842105264

The seller declines the trade offer but indicates a willingness to negotiate. The buyer then proposes a higher price of $1000 and offers to come pick up the item. The seller counters with a higher price of $1200 and offers to deliver the item. Given the context, it seems that the buyer is interested in purchasing the bike and is willing to negotiate the price. The seller is also willing to negotiate but wants a higher price. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, indicating that there is room for further negotiation. However, since the buyer is willing to pay $1000 and the seller is willing to accept $1200, it seems that the final price will be closer to the seller's target.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller who are discussing the price of a bed. The buyer initiates the conversation by acknowledging the sale and expressing interest in the item. The seller confirms the sale and states the price of $200. The buyer then attempts to negotiate the price by offering $100 and suggesting a pickup condition. The seller rejects this offer and sets a minimum acceptable price of $150. The buyer does not respond with a new offer, so the negotiation ends without a final agreement. Given the intentions and actions in the negotiation, it appears that the seller is firm on the price and the buyer is trying to negotiate a lower price. However, without a final offer from the buyer, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. Therefore, I will predict a price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller who are discussing the price of an apartment. The buyer expresses admiration for the apartment but finds the price too high and negotiates for a discount. The seller offers a senior discount, and the buyer continues to negotiate, indicating a willingness to pay $1250.00. However, the seller's final offer is $1300, which is still higher than the buyer's offer. Given this information, it seems that the seller is unwilling to go below $1300, and the buyer is willing to pay $1250.00. Since the buyer is willing to pay $1250.00 and the seller is unwilling to go below $1300, the projected sale price lies between $1250.00 and $1300.00.

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in purchasing a cell phone charger but is unsure. The seller asks for clarification on the buyer's needs and the type of charger they are looking for. The buyer specifies that they need a charger for their Android phone. The seller asks for the phone model but the buyer does not provide it. This negotiation is relatively straightforward and lacks aggressive or confrontational language. Given the lack of specific details about the phone model and the charger, it's difficult to determine the exact value of the item. However, the seller's initial offer is $10, and the buyer's target is $5. Considering the buyer's uncertainty and lack of specific details, it's likely that they are looking for a lower price. Given this information, a reasonable projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, I predict the final sale price to be $8.00.

In this negotiation, the buyer is interested in renting the property but is concerned about the rent price due to the exclusion of utilities. The seller initially offers a rent price of $2430, which is too high for the buyer. The buyer negotiates for a lower rent price of $1000, but the seller counters with a higher price of $2300, contingent on the buyer having good employment. The buyer does not respond to this counteroffer, indicating that the negotiation has stalled. Given this information, it seems that the buyer is unable to accept the seller's final offer, but there is no further negotiation to provide a final projected sale price. However, since the negotiation ended without a final agreement, we can assume that the buyer and seller were unable to come to an agreement. Given this, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. In this case, it seems reasonable to assume that the seller would be willing to negotiate further, but the buyer does not respond, so the projected sale price is likely to be closer to the seller's target. However, there is no clear indication of the buyer's willingness to pay a higher rent price. Therefore, the projected sale price is likely to be lower than the seller's target but higher than the buyer's target. Given this, a reasonable estimate for the projected sale price would be the average of the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing a rental property. The buyer expresses interest and asks about the location's proximity to stores and restaurants. The seller confirms the convenience of the location. The buyer makes a financial offer of $1891, and the seller asks about the buyer's living situation and habits. Since the buyer is making a direct financial offer and the seller is inquiring about the buyer's habits, it seems like the negotiation is heading towards a sale. However, the seller's questions suggest that they are trying to gauge the buyer's suitability for the property. Given this context, it is likely that the seller will accept the buyer's offer or make a counteroffer that is close to the buyer's offer. Therefore, I predict the projected sale price to be $1900.00, which is between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a simple inquiry about the item's functionality. The buyer asks about the speed of the item, which suggests they are interested in its performance. The seller is ready to provide information and answer questions, indicating they are willing to engage in the negotiation. Given the lack of complexity and the fact that the buyer is only asking a question, it's likely that the negotiation will be straightforward and that the seller will provide the necessary information. However, there is no indication of a price negotiation, so it's difficult to predict the final sale price. The projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets, but without more information, it's hard to determine the exact amount. Given the simplicity of the negotiation, it's possible that the final sale price will be closer to the seller's target of $200. However, without more context, it's hard to make an accurate prediction. FINAL_PRICE: $175.0<|eot_id|>",100,200,200.0,175.0,1.0,0.75,3.125

This negotiation involves a buyer and a seller discussing the price of a car. The buyer initially expresses interest in the car and states a budget of $2660. The seller provides positive information about the car's condition and offers a counter-offer of $3200, justifying the higher price with new tires. The buyer does not immediately respond to the counter-offer, but the negotiation appears to be ongoing. Given the lack of immediate response from the buyer, it's likely that the negotiation is still in progress. However, based on the information provided, it seems that the seller is willing to negotiate and the buyer is open to a higher price. Therefore, a projected sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets is reasonable. Given the context, I predict the projected sale price to be around $2900, which is closer to the seller's target but still negotiable for the buyer.

Seller is trying to sell the house, and the buyer is interested in it. The buyer is asking for specific details about the property, and the seller is providing them. The negotiation is going well, with both parties being friendly and cooperative. However, there is no mention of a price, so we cannot determine the final sale price.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a clock from a seller. The seller is motivated to sell the clock due to moving and has a strong attachment to it, which implies they are willing to negotiate. The buyer initiates a conversation and expresses interest in the clock, inquiring about its background. The seller provides a personal story about the clock's origin and explains the reason for selling. This establishes a rapport and sets the stage for price negotiation. Given the seller's attachment to the item, it's likely they will be willing to negotiate the price downwards. However, the buyer does not make a specific offer, and the negotiation does not progress further. To predict the projected sale price, we need to infer the intentions and interests of both parties. Since the seller is attached to the item and the buyer is interested, it's likely they can come to a mutually agreeable price. However, without further negotiation, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact number. Given the buyer's interest and the seller's attachment, a fair estimate lies between the buyer and seller targets. Therefore, I will choose a projected sale price that lies in the middle of the given targets. FINAL_PRICE: $625.0<|eot_id|>",375,750,500.0,625.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,31.25

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a phone from a seller. The buyer initially expresses interest and requests more information about the phone's condition. The seller assures the buyer that the phone is brand new. The buyer then expresses willingness to purchase but negotiates the price, inquiring if the seller would be willing to lower it. Given the context, the buyer is interested in the phone and is willing to negotiate the price, but the seller has already stated that the phone is brand new, which might make the buyer more likely to purchase at a higher price. However, the buyer still expresses concern about the price being too high for their budget. This indicates that the buyer is willing to negotiate but is not willing to go over their budget. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between the buyer and seller targets. The seller's initial price is $320, and the buyer's initial offer is $160. Given the context, a reasonable projection would be around $240. This is a fair price considering the phone is brand new and the buyer is willing to negotiate but has a budget constraint.

In this negotiation, the buyer is concerned about the additional work done on the car and its potential impact on reliability. The seller provides a guarantee of the car's reliability and lack of issues, which seems to alleviate the buyer's concerns. However, the buyer still seems hesitant to make an offer. The seller is confident in the car's condition and seems willing to negotiate the price. Given this context, it's likely that the buyer will make an offer lower than the seller's target but higher than the buyer's target. Therefore, the projected sale price lies between $22500 and $45000.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing an iPad Air case and a seller providing information about the product's features and durability. The buyer expresses concern about the product's durability, and the seller assures them that it is very durable. Given the context, it seems like the buyer is interested in purchasing the product, and the seller is willing to provide information to alleviate the buyer's concerns. However, there is no direct negotiation of the price in this conversation. Since the buyer is interested in the product and the seller is providing assurance about its durability, it's likely that the buyer is willing to pay a price that is closer to the seller's target. Therefore, I predict the projected sale price to be between the buyer and seller targets. FINAL_PRICE: $15.0<|eot_id|>",10,20,15.0,15.0,0.5,0.5,0.0

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing a dresser from a seller. The buyer initially expresses interest in the dresser and inquires about its condition, specifically asking if there are any other issues besides the missing handle. The seller clarifies the condition, stating that the handle is included and there are only minor beauty marks from regular use. The buyer seems to be concerned about the missing handle and wants to ensure that there are no other issues. The seller provides a clear and detailed response to alleviate the buyer's concerns. Given this context, it appears that the buyer is interested in the dresser but wants to negotiate the price due to its condition. However, the negotiation does not explicitly involve price negotiation. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the projected sale price accurately. However, since the buyer is interested in the dresser and the seller is providing detailed information, it is likely that the sale price will be somewhere between the buyer and seller targets. Since the buyer is not explicitly making an offer and the seller is not accepting the buyer's implied interest, it is difficult to predict the exact sale price. Given the lack of explicit price negotiation, I will assume that the buyer is willing to pay the full price, but the seller might be willing to negotiate it slightly. Therefore, I will predict a sale price that lies between the buyer and seller targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in purchasing an iPhone and a seller willing to negotiate the price. The buyer inquires about the condition of the iPhone, and the seller assures them that it is in great condition. Given this information, it seems like the iPhone is in good condition, which would support a lower price. However, the buyer does not make any specific price offers or negotiate further, so it's difficult to determine a projected sale price. Since the buyer does not make any counter-offers and the negotiation ends abruptly, it's hard to predict a specific price. Given the lack of negotiation, I will choose a price that is roughly in the middle of the given targets.

This negotiation involves a buyer interested in getting their computer fixed and a seller offering repair services at a price of $15. The buyer inquires about potential discounts, and the seller expresses willingness to negotiate but sets a boundary. Given this information, it seems that the seller is open to negotiating but has a minimum price in mind. The buyer is looking for a discount, so it's likely that they will try to negotiate the price down. However, the seller's initial price of $15 is quite low, and they seem willing to negotiate, so it's possible that the buyer could get a better deal.

This negotiation involves a buyer and seller discussing the price of a Honda. The seller initially states that the car is worth $6900, but the buyer disagrees and suggests a lower price due to the car's age. The seller attempts to justify the price by mentioning additional features, but the buyer remains unconvinced. Given the buyer's concerns about the car's age and the seller's inability to sway the buyer, it seems that the buyer is unlikely to pay a high price. However, the seller is also unwilling to budge significantly, indicating that there is some room for negotiation. Projecting a sale price between $4059 and $5800, I would predict a final price of $5050. This is a compromise between the buyer's and seller's initial offers, taking into account the buyer's concerns and the seller's attempts to justify the price.
