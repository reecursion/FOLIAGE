            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: The weather is going to be really hot. Could I have 2 water in exchange for you receiving 2 food and 2 firewood?, Agent 2: I have a low immune system and need to stay warm how about I get all 3 firewood in exchange for the 2 water., Agent 1: I will agree to 3 firewood for 2 water.

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hey there!, Agent 1: Hi! What are your preferences?, Agent 2: Food is of the highest preference for me! I am a diabetic and always need to be able to eat if I'm experiencing a low! How about you?, Agent 1: Food is also my highest preference, followed by firewood, with water being the lowest. I don't have a medical condition that needs food so I can give you 2 units if I can have 1?, Agent 2: That would be great if you could!

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hello.  I hope you are well.  I would like to have all of the water, 2 of the firewood and 1 of the food., Agent 2: Hello.  I'm actually not doing too well.  There have been a few problems and I will need some of the extra packages.  I'll need two of the waters, 2 of the firewood and 2 of the food., Agent 1: I'm sorry to hear that you are not doing well.  I've also have some issues.  On the way up to the camp site, all of my clean water spilled in the car.  I was really hoping to be able to get all of the available water.  Why aren't you well?  I hope it's not serious.  ☹️, Agent 2: Oh, that's terrible.  I'm sorry that happened.  I need the water for my child.  They seem dehydrated and disoriented.  My husband has also caught a cold and has been having chills.  I thought the extra firewood would help him feel better., Agent 1: Oh my gosh.  You are not having an easy trip.  If your children are dehydrated and disoriented, perhaps you should get them to emergency care immediately.  I would like to provide you will all of the water in the meantime, but that would leave me with none at all.  I wouldn't have your husband out of the tent with chills.  Perhaps you should keep him bundled in your cabin.  I forgot my portable propane grill - so I would need some firewood.  How about I take 2 waters, 1 firewood and all of the food?, Agent 2: Oh dear, you spilled your water and forgot your grill?  You mentioned that you had a car.  Perhaps you could take a quick drive to grab some extra water.  For now, I definitely agree that you need 1 extra water and 1 firewood.  I will need 2 of the extra food portions though.  How does that sound?
