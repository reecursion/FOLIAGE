You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: I need the food and water.  You can have all the firewood., Agent 1: hello how are you?  I need the food the most because I ran off and left mine sitting on my kitchen counter.  I think we can agree upon you having 2 water but I need 2 food, Agent 2: I'm going hiking, and I really need food, it works up an appetite. , [Summary: Two participants are negotiating the distribution of resources. Agent 2 needs food and water for a hiking trip and offers all the firewood. Agent 1 also needs food, having forgotten theirs at home, and suggests a compromise where they receive two food items and agent 2 gets two water items.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:
