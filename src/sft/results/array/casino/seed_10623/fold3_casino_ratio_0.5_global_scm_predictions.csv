Nice to get out after being inside for most of the spring. This covid-19 crap! wish it would go away., Agent 2: I agree!  I will say it has really sparked my interest in camping and being outdoors even more though!

Even though the nights are cold I could use some extra water. Do you exercise much?, Agent 2: It has been extremely dry in the area I will be going to so I was hoping to get a little extra water too.  I do. I love hiking and running trails!  Due to the extreme dry weather I should have plenty of wood I can scavenge for if you need all of it!, [Summary: user1 (mturk_agent_1):
