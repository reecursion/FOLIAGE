You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hello, what are your preferences for extra supplies?  I am greatly in need of food and water.  We will be doing a lot of activity in a hot, dry climate.üôÇ, Agent 2: I prefer firewood because I will get cold at night. I forgot blankets ‚òπÔ∏è, Agent 1: Would it work for you, then, to give me the three food and three water, and I can give you all of the firewood?, Agent 2: No. Because I brought a water purifier but don't plan on hunting or fishing. So I'd be willing to give up all the water but I want 2 of the food.

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hi, I'd like to take all of the food and 2 of fire wood. You can have the rest., Agent 2: I really need food too so if I can have 2 packages of food you can have 1 package of firewood and all 3 of the water., Agent 1: üòÆThat does not work for me. May I have 3 packages of food and one package of water. You can have the rest., Agent 2: Sorry, but I definitely can't accept not having any food. I'll take 1 package of food, and all of the firewood and then you can have the water.

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            OUTCOME: {agent1:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}, agent2:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}}
