You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three.

            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

I drink a lot of water so it's important that I bring a lot. What about you?, Agent 1: I really am! I have been watching the weather and updates about the area I will be traveling to.  They are experiencing a severe drought, so I will be in need of some extra water as well! I planned on staying an extra couple days as well.  There is a stream nearby I believe, but I'm not sure how much it has dried up., Agent 2: That's good to hear, you always have to be careful with wild water though, it has all kind of germs.

            Agent 2: Hello, I'm in a strong need for food and water. Please let me have a few packages of food and water. I'd gladly trade all my firewood for it., Agent 1: Hello. Wow! That does not sound good. My sister just called and let me know she will be coming tonight. She is bringing food so i have plenty to share. üôÇ, Agent 2: That's some good news. üôÇ Are you sure she is going to be bringing food with her?, Agent 1: Yea She is bring tons of food. So don't worry we have plenty of food to spare. üôÇ She did forget to get water. I didn't know she was coming so i didn't grab any and I forgot the 3 packages of water for myself at the store. ‚òπÔ∏è, Agent 2: Yikes, that's not good. Water is very important, especially if you now have to take care of two people at your campsite now. I do have 3 packages of water but I don't think I can spare it all., Agent 1: I tell you what if we trade 3 food for 3 waters! I think that would be fair snice you said you need some food and snice I need some water. üôÇ, Agent 2: Well, I do have some food but if I trade you all 3 packages of water, I won't have any at all. How about 2 packages of water, so we each have 1 package, including your sister?, Agent 1: How about this it think it will work out better for us and you snice you need fire wood too. You get 3 food and 2 firewood and and I get 3 water and 1 firewood. üôÇüôÇ, Agent 2: I really don't want to be without water, how about 2 water and 2 firewood for the 3 packages of food?, Agent 1: I just want to make sure I understand you I get 2 waters and 2 firewood and 0 food., Agent 2: That's right. Since you would be getting food from your sister, while I am camping alone, you would be getting more food pretty soon.

I think I would stick to your original proposal.

I do need the firewood to cook the fish but I dont need it to keep warm at night because I have hefty sleeping bags that work excellent in the cold., Agent 2: That could work, but I'm still a little worried I won't have enough food for 6 people.
