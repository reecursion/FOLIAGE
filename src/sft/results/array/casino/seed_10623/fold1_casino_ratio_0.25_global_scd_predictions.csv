You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hi, Agent 2: Hi! 🙂, Agent 1: So what are you thinking about how we should split this? i really want firewood, as i am anemic and have a hard time in the cold weather during the nights here, [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly greeting and quickly shifts to a negotiation about dividing resources. One speaker expresses a personal need for firewood due to health reasons, indicating a strategy of appealing to empathy to influence the decision. The conversation is set to explore how each participant will advocate for their needs and potentially reach a compromise.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            OUTCOME: {agent1:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}, agent2:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}}

            Remember: Each resource must sum to exactly 3 units across both agents.<|eot_id|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
