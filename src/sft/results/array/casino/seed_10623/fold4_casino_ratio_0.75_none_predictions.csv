You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hello, what are your preferences for extra supplies?  I am greatly in need of food and water.  We will be doing a lot of activity in a hot, dry climate.üôÇ, Agent 2: I prefer firewood because I will get cold at night. I forgot blankets ‚òπÔ∏è, Agent 1: Would it work for you, then, to give me the three food and three water, and I can give you all of the firewood?, Agent 2: No. Because I brought a water purifier but don't plan on hunting or fishing. So I'd be willing to give up all the water but I want 2 of the food., Agent 1: I see.  I also greatly need the extra food, as I indicated. Perhaps there are some convenience or grocery stores near your campground--you might then purchase extra food there and not have to carry it with you on your trip?, Agent 2: I believe there won't be any convenience stores around to buy food, And I plan on staying out longer than you so I will need more food to last me, Do you need food or water more?, Agent 1: How do you know you are staying longer than me? I haven't even said how long I am staying! I am also with a big group.  ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è  I need food the most, and I would like to take at least 2 extra waters.  I could possibly give up one of the food packages if you could part with 2 firewood.  Without extra food, I would have to do some fishing and cook the fish., Agent 2: No. I won't part with any firewood because I can't stand being cold, and you can have 2 foods if you have a larger group if you give me 1 water. üôÇüôÇ

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hi there! How are you today?, Agent 1: Good!  How are you?, Agent 2: I'm doing well! Almost ready for my camping trip. Need some more supplies though., Agent 1: Which supplies do you need?, Agent 2: Well, I really need water in case we get really thirsty from hiking. I also need firewood in case it gets colder and we need more. It would be cool to have more food added for dessert like s'mores, but it's not really necessary., Agent 1: How about you take all the water and one of the firewoods, and I can have all the food and 2 of the firewoods, Agent 2: Let me think about it. What supplies do you need?

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hello, what is your preference for supplies?  I would prefer to have as much extra firewood as possible, but am relatively indifferent to the rest., Agent 1: yes we have to supply more how much you want, Agent 2: I would like 3 firewood, and 2 food.  You can have 1 food and all of the water., Agent 1: oh okay I will send you what are the materials you have, Agent 2: I already have a good supply of fresh water from the lake I will be camping by, and can hunt for some food but not all.  What are you in need of?, Agent 1: oh that's great, what type of quality you have from us, Agent 2: I have high quality water?  I'm not sure if I understand that question to be honest., Agent 1: oh okay, you understand correctly, when you take the material from us, Agent 2: Okay, sounds good then.  I believe we have a deal then.

            Agent 2: HI. I'd love to get 2 additional packs of firewood. The weather forecast was for much warmer weather here and I just didn't bring enough with me. I also left my additional sweatshirt at home. I'd be happy to give you one additional water and two of food.  üôÇüôÇ, Agent 1: Well I had a really great day fishing today and I would like to have some extra firewood so I can cook all of this fish.  How about I take the 3 packages of firewood and you can keep 2 additional food packages in return., Agent 2: You really did have a good day didn't you! Sounds like fun. How many fish can one person eat? If I don't have the extra firewood I'm going to be really cold tonight. ‚òπÔ∏è, Agent 1: I am here with my family and we love to eat fish.üôÇ  Maybe if you spend tonight sleeping in your car or camper I can keep the fire wood. In exchange I will give you the 2 additional food packages and all 3 of the water packages. It's only for 1 night., Agent 2: Why would you want to give up all that water? You're going to need extra water for your family to drink. All the sodium in the fish is going to make you all thirsty!, Agent 1: Your right,üòÆ  I didn't think about that. But will probably only need 1 extra package of water so, in exchange I will offer you 1 package of firewood., Agent 2: I know this isn't your problem, but I'm a student and I had to come up here to take photos of the night sky for my astronomy class. I slept really late today as I have to sit up all night to get the different stars, and possibly even the space station if it's clear enough out. I have to sit by a fire to stay warm so I can get these pictures to hand in to my professor tomorrow., Agent 1: You know that is very impressive.  I admire your determination and effort you put into your class.  You must be very passionate about astronomy., Agent 2: I am. My favorite personality is Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He's amazing, funny and incredibly smart. I'm hoping to get an internship at the Planetarium in my senior year üôÇ, Agent 1: That's amazing!!!  So here is the deal...I'll give you the 2 firewood packages so you can sleep under the stars tonight.  In return I'll have to keep 2 water packages and 2 food packages since I won't be able to cook all of this fish and I still have a family to feed., Agent 2: I'm glad you understand my problem. But I really need those 3 firewood packages. I'd be happy to give you 2 water packages and all the food in exchange., Agent 1: Initially you were willing to take the 2 packages of firewood. If you have all three I won't be able to cook any of this fish and it will all go to waste. ‚òπÔ∏è

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hi!  I am excited to go camping!  I would love to get 3 extra food and 3 water since we will be canoe camping and won't be able to purchase more., Agent 2: I am going camping too.  May I ask where you are going canoe camping?, Agent 1: We are going to camp in Oregon.  We are looking forward to it.  The views and scenery should be gorgeous.  How about you?, Agent 2: I am going to the Allegheny mountains in Pennsylvania.  I'm going to be hiking a lot so I will need some extra food.  Let's balance out the food and water somehow...., Agent 1: Sounds good.  We will also be hiking a bunch and I have little kids who go through water and food like crazy., Agent 2: What if I get 2 food packages and 1 water package....and you would get 1 food package and 2 waters?, Agent 1: I think we will need more extra food than that.  How about the reverse, I get 2 food and 1 water and you get 1 food and 2 water.

            Agent 2: Hi! I look forward to making a trade with you that's good for us both., Agent 1: Me too, hopefully we can get together on a deal., Agent 2: I'm hoping so too. What's most valuable to you?, Agent 1: Water, what about you?, Agent 2: Food, but I definitely do need some water, too. Can you live with taking 2 waters?, Agent 1: Yes, can you live with two foods?, Agent 2: I can. How about firewood? I would like 2 if possible., Agent 1: Well there are only 3., Agent 2: Of course. Since you're getting more water, I was hoping to get 2 firewood, and you could have the remaining 1. Would that work for you?, Agent 1: Water was my high priority and food was your's, so I think we already split the difference there., Agent 2: Okay, so how do you propose splitting the firewood?
