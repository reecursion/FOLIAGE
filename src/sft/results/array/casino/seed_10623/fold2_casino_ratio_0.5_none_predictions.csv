You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

However, I think that if we are both reasonable, we should be able to come to an agreement., Agent 1: I think so too.

How about we start by saying you get the firewood, and I'll take the food?, Agent 1: OK, but how do we split up the water? Because it sounds like we both need some. What if you take all the food and I take all the firewood and then I get two waters and you get one extra?, Agent 2: I would prefer to have 2 waters since I agreed to give you all the firewood., Agent 1: But I agreed to give you all the food. Now that you want two waters, I think I should have some food because I left a bag of my food at home. You get two waters and I get one of the food. Then you get the majority of both the water and food.

            Agent 2: Hello, how are you? 🙂, we are excited to go camping for 2 weeks. I was wondering, if its okay with you, if I can get all 3 waters? what are your thoughts? we have a large group, lots of kids, need the extra water for cooking, putting out camp fire, and keeping all of us warm at night., Agent 1: Hi, I am great 🙂 How are you? I would be happy for you to have two waters if I can have one. I would also like to have three things of food. I love cooking outside, so I would love to make large delicious meals for my group to enjoy, Agent 2: That sounds amazing and delicious! maybe we can compromise? Maybe, I can get all 3 waters and you can have all 3 Foods? what do you think?, Agent 1: I would agree to that if I can also have two things of firewood. I am going to need a lot of wood, so I can cook the meals I am making 🙂, Agent 2: I completely understand, thank you for compromising with water and food. Wished we had 4 firewoods to divide and share it equaly, may I ask how long will you be camping for? Im afraid I need 2 firewoods as well, maybe we can see who has the greater need?, Agent 1: I am going to be camping for a couple of weeks, so I will need quite a bit. I also realized some additional water would be good, because I have some meals that need me to boil water. Maybe you can have 2 firewood in exchange for me having one of your waters? Then you would still have plenty of water, but also plenty of firewood 🙂

            Agent 2: Hi! I'm super excited to go camping with my family as a great way to vacation due to Covid19. My kid is so restless from being cooped up in the house all the time. Are you planning on going camping too?, Agent 1: I am! It is the perfect way to get away and still manage to social distance! I am worried about having enough water though, are you short on any supplies?, Agent 2: I think I'm good. I'm not 100% sure. My husband likes to do adventures on the fly. He got these water filter straw thingies from Amazon and said that if we run out of the water I packed, that we can drink the water in the lake but I don't really trust the straws., Agent 1: Sounds like you need water too. How about you take 2 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood?, Agent 2: I don't know, you said you're worried about having enough water too. I'm excited to make campfires though! My kid hasn't had a campfire smore yet so I'm super excited to see his face of joy when he experiences it.

            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hi there! How are you?, Agent 1: Hello good morning I'm well thank you., Agent 2: Let's talk about what we need. First, I don't eat meat, so I really feel like I'd need a little extra food, as I couldn't hunt or forage for food at all. I feel like I could survive without a ton of water, but would need water, as I hike a lot and cant trust any sources, Agent 1: I've also planned my trip to include a lot of hiking and so I have a high priority for extra water, as like you've said you need to stay hydrated on your hike and you can't trust any source.

We have a large group and will be active.  We will have some hot and dry conditions in the desert. Some are high school age students with big appetites.  What are your preferences., Agent 2: I was definitely looking to have food and firewood most of all. There are plenty of places to collect rainwater and get fresh water in Puget Sound, but we're lacking in food and will need firewood to start a campfire at night.
