You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hello how are you today? 🙂 Do you have any initial ideas on how to split everything?, Agent 2: I was thinking maybe I could have a majority of the fire food and you can have a majority of the water and food., Agent 1: What exactly do you mean by majority? As in everything ?, Agent 2: I was more thinking 2 Firewood for me , 1 food and 1 water? The rest would be yours., Agent 1: That is a promising bargain but I want at least 2 firewood, it makes for a fun time for my group., Agent 2: Interesting , because my group feels the same way though. How does your group feel about water though?, Agent 1: Water is not that important for us but the firewood is a deal breaker for us ☹️, Agent 2: I see.... Well we really would like the firewood too though. Could you reconsider it makes a big difference for us., Agent 1: Sorry I will only consider a deal if I can get at least two fire wood., Agent 2: Well if that is the case then I want 1 Firewood 3 waters and 2 Food then.

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            Agent 1: Hey! For the camping trip it would be awesome if I could have 3 packages of food. My friend is gluten and dairy free and we need as many options as possible for her., Agent 2: Aww I'm sorry to hear that, it sounds like it might be better to have her bring her own food. I'll be bringing my teenage son so it would be awesome to get any extra food for him that I can. You know how they be! 🙂, Agent 1: What about I take 2 of the packages and you take 1? I know teenagers also drink a lot of water haha 🙂, Agent 2: He definitely does drink a lot of water, but he's in a growth spurt so 2 would be ideal. I'm happy to give up all firewood in exchange for the extra food!, Agent 1: okay that sounds like a better deal then! I will take all the firewood and 1 food, and you can take the 2 food packages, Agent 2: Awesome, I appreciate that. How does the water need look on your side?

            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hi there, I really need some water because I don't have enough to get by, Agent 2: Good afternoon. Ok, water is a medium need for me. I have some to get by. I really need firewood. It's cold., Agent 1: I'd be willing to give up all the firewood in exchange for the water.

            This outcome is based on the following logic:

            Agent 2 initially offers a deal where they get 3 firewood, 2 water, and 1 food. Agent 1 rejects this deal, so Agent 2 threatens to walk away. Agent 1 does not negotiate further, so Agent 2 will take all the remaining resources. Agent 2 gets 2 food and 2 water, while Agent 1 gets 1 food and 1 water. Agent 2 gets 2 firewood, and Agent 1 gets 2 firewood.

            I predict this outcome because Agent 1 is willing to give up all the food and one package of water for two packages of firewood. Agent 2 is willing to accept this deal because they are able to get two packages of firewood, which is their highest priority. Agent 2 is also able to get all the food and one package of water, which is sufficient for their needs. This deal allows both agents to get at least one of each resource, and Agent 1 gets the majority of the firewood, which is their highest priority.<|eot_id|>",0,1,2,3,2,1,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,14,22,24.0,12.0,100.0

            I predict this based on the following reasoning:

            Agent 2 is offering a deal where they get 3 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood. Agent 1 is accepting this deal but then asks for 2 water. Agent 2 agrees to this deal. Agent 1 then asks for 2 firewood. Agent 2 says this deal is going to be hard for them but Agent 1 does not budge. Based on this, it seems like Agent 1 is getting the better deal. 

            Since Agent 1 was only able to negotiate for 2 additional resources, I predict they will only get 2 additional resources. Agent 2 was able to negotiate for 3 additional resources but will only end up with 3 additional resources. Based on this, I predict Agent 1 will get 0 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood, while Agent 2 will get 3 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood.<|eot_id|>",0,2,2,3,1,1,0.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,18,22,18.0,22.0,0.0

            I predict this outcome because Agent 2 offered to give Agent 1 another food in exchange for two firewood. Agent 1 accepted this deal, as they stated they need to lose weight and do not require much food or water. Agent 2 gets two food, two water, and one firewood, while Agent 1 gets one food, one water, and two firewood.

Nice to get out after being inside for most of the spring. This covid-19 crap! wish it would go away., Agent 2: I agree!  I will say it has really sparked my interest in camping and being outdoors even more though! I saw just how connected I was to technology and everything else!, Agent 1: I'm up here to do some cross training and noticed that there is some extra water around. Even though the nights are cold I could use some extra water. Do you exercise much?, Agent 2: It has been extremely dry in the area I will be going to so I was hoping to get a little extra water too.  I do. I love hiking and running trails!  Due to the extreme dry weather I should have plenty of wood I can scavenge for if you need all of it!, Agent 1: Hmm. Maybe we could go out together on a run. 🙂Always nice to have a running partner. So maybe on the water you get 2, me 1. Then on the Firewood the opposite?

            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            OUTCOME: {agent1:{food:0, water:3, firewood:2}, agent2:{food:3, water:0, firewood:1}}

            I propose this deal because Agent 2 has stated that food is their highest priority, so I suggest they take all the food. Agent 1 has stated that water is their highest priority, so I suggest they take all the water. Agent 2 mentioned that their friend has low blood sugar and may need extra food, so I suggest they take the firewood as well so they can keep a fire going if their friend needs it. Agent 1 can then use the firewood to boil water. This way, both agents get their highest priority item and still have some of the other items., Agent 2: So, you want to take all 3 waters, and 2 firewood, while I take all 3 food?, Agent 1: Yes, that sounds good to me., Agent 2: Okay, that sounds good to me. I would like to take 1 firewood though. My friend is cold, and could use the extra warmth. I will give you the extra water to boil for yourself. What do you think?, Agent 1: I think that sounds good. I can use the water to boil food if I need to. I'll take two firewood then., Agent 2: Okay, I think that's a fair deal. Thank you! It will help keep my friend safe.🙂🙂, Agent 1: You're welcome, I appreciate it. Have a great camping trip!🙂🙂

            Based on this negotiation, I predict the final allocation of resources as:
