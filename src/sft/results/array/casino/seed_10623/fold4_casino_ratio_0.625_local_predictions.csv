You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hello, what are your preferences for extra supplies?  I am greatly in need of food and water.  We will be doing a lot of activity in a hot, dry climate.üôÇ, Agent 2: I prefer firewood because I will get cold at night. I forgot blankets ‚òπÔ∏è, Agent 1: Would it work for you, then, to give me the three food and three water, and I can give you all of the firewood?, Agent 2: No. Because I brought a water purifier but don't plan on hunting or fishing. So I'd be willing to give up all the water but I want 2 of the food., Agent 1: I see.  I also greatly need the extra food, as I indicated. Perhaps there are some convenience or grocery stores near your campground--you might then purchase extra food there and not have to carry it with you on your trip?, Agent 2: I believe there won't be any convenience stores around to buy food, And I plan on staying out longer than you so I will need more food to last me, Do you need food or water more?

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 2: I have a medical condition that causes my veins to close up when I get too cold. I will thus need the 3 firewood., Agent 1: ‚òπÔ∏èOh, that sounds awful.

            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hi! What sort of packages are you looking for today?, Agent 2: Hi there! I am looking to have 3 packages of firewood, 2 packages of food, and 1 package of water please., Agent 1: Oh we have similar priorities üôÇI am also interested in getting firewood, because I have a condition that makes me very cold, colder than the average person, so I need to make sure I have enough for the trip. Why do you want food, Agent 2: That make sense. I need firewood though too because I have an autoimmune disease. When it flares up - when it gets too cold - I get very sick and have to go to the hospital. I need to make sure I have enough for the trip as well. I need food to keep my metabolism up so I can make sure my disease stays in check. Why do you want food?, Agent 1: That makes sense . I have a friend coming with me on the camping trip, and she also needs to eat, so I'd like to get an extra package of food if possible., Agent 2: Okay that would be fine. If I can have 3 packages of firewood, you can have 2 packages of food. Does that work?

I also left my additional sweatshirt at home. I'd be happy to give you one additional water and two of food.  üôÇüôÇ, Agent 1: Well I had a really great day fishing today and I would like to have some extra firewood so I can cook all of this fish.  How about I take the 3 packages of firewood and you can keep 2 additional food packages in return., Agent 2: You really did have a good day didn't you! Sounds like fun. How many fish can one person eat? If I don't have the extra firewood I'm going to be really cold tonight. ‚òπÔ∏è, Agent 1: I am here with my family and we love to eat fish.üôÇ  Maybe if you spend tonight sleeping in your car or camper I can keep the fire wood. In exchange I will give you the 2 additional food packages and all 3 of the water packages. It's only for 1 night., Agent 2: Why would you want to give up all that water? You're going to need extra water for your family to drink. All the sodium in the fish is going to make you all thirsty!, Agent 1: Your right,üòÆ  I didn't think about that. But will probably only need 1 extra package of water so, in exchange I will offer you 1 package of firewood., Agent 2: I know this isn't your problem, but I'm a student and I had to come up here to take photos of the night sky for my astronomy class. I slept really late today as I have to sit up all night to get the different stars, and possibly even the space station if it's clear enough out. I have to sit by a fire to stay warm so I can get these pictures to hand in to my professor tomorrow., Agent 1: You know that is very impressive.  I admire your determination and effort you put into your class.  You must be very passionate about astronomy., Agent 2: I am. My favorite personality is Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He's amazing, funny and incredibly smart. I'm hoping to get an internship at the Planetarium in my senior year üôÇ, Agent 1: That's amazing!!!  So here is the deal...I'll give you the 2 firewood packages so you can sleep under the stars tonight.  In return I'll have to keep 2 water packages and 2 food packages since I won't be able to cook all of this fish and I still have a family to feed.

            Agent 2: Hello! camper, how are you? I need us to make a deal where we all benefit.I'm so excited for our camping trip.  I'm most excited about getting to eat food that I normally don't when I am home.üôÇ, Agent 1: I am excited too and looking forward to making a deal that works well for both of us!, Agent 2: My main objective for the camp is water, since I have a large family and the amount of water they give in the camp is very small for all my family., Agent 1: I need water also but firewood is my second highest priority item. Maybe you could take more of the water and I could take more of the firewood., Agent 2: I find it a good deal, however before making a deal, I like to talk to people, get to know them better. I plan to go to camp with my family: my wife, my four children and myself. Are you going with your family?, Agent 1: Yes, I am going with my wife and two teenage sons. We are planning on doing a lot of fishing!

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 2: Hi there.  I'm really looking forward to this camping trip!  Hope we can make a deal over these extra supplies.  üôÇ  I was hoping to do some hiking and swimming away from my campsite, so having some extra fresh water would be really helpful to me., Agent 1: Hello there.  I too am looking forward to this trip.  Definitely need to decompress., Agent 2: Sounds like it'll be great for both of us.  Is there anything extra you need?, Agent 1: My favorite thing to do around the campfire is to sing songs.  I also like to do extra hiking as well.  I especially need firewood., Agent 2: Well, I could see fit to give you the extra firewood (If I can hear a few of your songs!) if you don't mind letting me take the water., Agent 1: Hahaha, once you hear my singing you might hope the opposite.  I can do that with the firewood and water, but I really would prefer two of the remaining foods., Agent 2: I could also use the extra food, so can we resolve it amicably?  Coin flip maybe?
