Can you clarify?, Agent 1: what i mean by prevention of excess is that we should focus on getting excess and not to limit it regardless of what we already have because if we should offer some creative approaches by excess. we can both come to an agreement if you are interested., Agent 2: Okay. Lets just try to do some negotiation. I am the most interested in getting more WATER. The water I already have at the campsite looks dirty so, if it is okay with you, I would like all THREE of them. My food has also been stolen by bears and I don't make much left, so I would like TWO of the food items. You can have all the firewood and the other food item. How does that sound? 🙂, Agent 1: 😮Sound good enough but since you know i can not do without having anything to sustain me whenever i am thirsty then i suggest you are free to take TWO of the water and since your food has also been stolen by bears and you don't make much left, then you can have the TWO of the food items too and leave the THREE firewood for me with ONE food.

How can we negotiate? I'd hate for something to happen to you., Agent 2: We can try to figure out a way to split the water and food in the fairest way 🙂.
