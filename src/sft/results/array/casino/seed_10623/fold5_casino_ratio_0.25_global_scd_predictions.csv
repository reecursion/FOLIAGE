You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: I'd like to have 2 extra packages of water and firewood., Agent 1: I see. And I would like 2 extra packages of Food and 2 packages of  Water as well., Agent 2: I have a great risk of dehydration.  I really need those 2 extra packages of water. You can have all the extra food. , [Summary: The conversation begins with both speakers expressing their needs for additional resources. Initially, both have similar requests, but as the conversation progresses, mturk_agent_2 emphasizes a critical need for water due to a risk of dehydration. This shifts the dynamic, with mturk_agent_2 prioritizing water over other resources and offering a compromise by allowing mturk_agent_1 to take all the extra food, indicating a strategic and cooperative approach to resource allocation.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

Unless none is needed for you then I will take them all., Agent 2: i will need 3 firewood packets.  I have a terrible disease that prevents my circulation from working properly., Agent 1: That does sound bad. I am going camping and my kids might want to stay up late so I will need extra firewood for this to keep light and more warmth. I will take all 3 extra of the food and the water but I need 2 firewood also., [Summary: The conversation begins with mturk_agent_1 proposing a distribution of resources, expressing a willingness to take all if mturk_agent_2 doesn't need any. Mturk_agent_2 then shares a personal health concern to justify their need for firewood. mturk_agent_1 acknowledges the concern but counters with their own need for firewood due to a family camping trip, maintaining their initial intention to secure resources while showing some empathy.]
