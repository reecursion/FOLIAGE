You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hello, what are your preferences for extra supplies?  I am greatly in need of food and water.  We will be doing a lot of activity in a hot, dry climate.üôÇ, Agent 2: I prefer firewood because I will get cold at night. I forgot blankets ‚òπÔ∏è, Agent 1: Would it work for you, then, to give me the three food and three water, and I can give you all of the firewood?, Agent 2: No. Because I brought a water purifier but don't plan on hunting or fishing. So I'd be willing to give up all the water but I want 2 of the food., Agent 1: I see.  I also greatly need the extra food, as I indicated. Perhaps there are some convenience or grocery stores near your campground--you might then purchase extra food there and not have to carry it with you on your trip? , [Summary: The conversation begins with both speakers expressing their specific needs for supplies, with one prioritizing food and water and the other firewood. As they negotiate, the second speaker maintains a firm stance on retaining some food due to their lack of hunting or fishing plans, despite having a water purifier. The first speaker suggests an alternative solution, indicating a willingness to compromise while subtly encouraging the second speaker to consider other options for obtaining food.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            OUTCOME: {agent1:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}, agent2:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}}

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three.
