            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 2: How about I take all the water and firewood, you can have all the food., Agent 1: I need water and firewood. I don't need as much food. I need water for my dog and firewood for warmth since I am camping during the winter, Agent 2: I need water because I'm going hiking, and the water from streams isn't safe to drink., Agent 1: I can give you 2 units of water, but I need at least 1.
