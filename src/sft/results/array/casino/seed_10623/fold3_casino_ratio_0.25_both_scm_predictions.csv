You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 2: Hello, Agent 1: hello, so what is your most important thing that you want?, Agent 2: my priority is firewood. What's yours? , [Summary: user1 (mturk_agent_1):
  warmth: low
  competence: low
  explanation: The initial greeting lacks warmth due to its abruptness and lack of personalization. The question about priorities is direct but lacks context or clarity, suggesting low competence in communication.

user2 (mturk_agent_2):
  warmth: high
  competence: high
  explanation: The response is polite and reciprocal, showing interest in the other person's priorities, which indicates high warmth. The clear articulation of their own priority demonstrates competence in communication.]
