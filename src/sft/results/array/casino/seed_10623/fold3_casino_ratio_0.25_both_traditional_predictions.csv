You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hey! For the camping trip it would be awesome if I could have 3 packages of food. My friend is gluten and dairy free and we need as many options as possible for her., Agent 2: Aww I'm sorry to hear that, it sounds like it might be better to have her bring her own food. I'll be bringing my teenage son so it would be awesome to get any extra food for him that I can. You know how they be! 🙂 , [Summary: The conversation is about planning a camping trip, with one person requesting gluten and dairy-free food options for a friend, while the other suggests the friend bring her own food. Additionally, the second person mentions bringing their teenage son and requests extra food for him.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 2: hello, Agent 1: Hey, how are you?, Agent 2: I am doing good. Thanks.

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: I will need 2 firewood, 2 water and 1 food, Agent 2: How about you take all the firewood because I have the skills necessary to chop down more. I also will need three packages of food because I will be climbing a very tall mountain., Agent 1: well i do need alot of firewood since i need it to start a fire , [Summary: Two individuals are negotiating resource distribution. Agent 1 needs firewood, water, and food, while Agent 2 offers all the firewood, as they can chop more, and requests more food due to a mountain climb. Agent 1 agrees, emphasizing their need for firewood to start a fire.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            OUTCOME: {agent1:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}, agent2:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}}

            Remember: Each resource must sum to exactly 3 units across both agents.<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
