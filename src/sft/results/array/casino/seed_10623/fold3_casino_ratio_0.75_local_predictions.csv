            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

The extra water will be very important for our group., Agent 1: I understand. We will have a big group (about 10 people) so we are trying to have as much water as possible as well. If anyone gets dehydrated it'd be the end of the trip and hard to get everyone back to base. What's the fewest amount of bottles you're willing to accept?, Agent 2: üòÆTwo packages is the lowest I would accept.  There is one exception to that.  If you were willing to give up 2 firewood, then I would be willing to take 1 water.  I think I could trade some extra firewood for water at the campsite., Agent 1: I understand. I am not willing to give up any firewood, but I'd be willing to do a trade of 1 food for 1 water. So 3 firewood for us, 1 water for us, and 1 food for us.

I'm happy to give you the food packages as well as we shouldn't need extras. Being around the fire, we are going to be hot as well and dehydrated. I say let's try and split the waters., Agent 2: We are going to be in an area where there is little potable water.  I don't have a water filter either.  The extra water will be very important for our group., Agent 1: I understand. We will have a big group (about 10 people) so we are trying to have as much water as possible as well. If anyone gets dehydrated it'd be the end of the trip and hard to get everyone back to base. What's the fewest amount of bottles you're willing to accept?, Agent 2: üòÆTwo packages is the lowest I would accept.  There is one exception to that.  If you were willing to give up 2 firewood, then I would be willing to take 1 water.  I think I could trade some extra firewood for water at the campsite., Agent 1: I understand. I am not willing to give up any firewood, but I'd be willing to do a trade of 1 food for 1 water. So 3 firewood for us, 1 water for us, and 1 food for us.
