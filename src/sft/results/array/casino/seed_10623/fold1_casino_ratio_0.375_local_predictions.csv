            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hi! Are you excited to go camping?, Agent 2: absolutely! the kids are absolutely looking forward to it. It's their first time, Agent 1: Yeah! we are going hiking after we unpack. We need a lot of water..., Agent 2: So do we. My kids are on meds so they need a lot of water and food

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            OUTCOME: {agent1:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}, agent2:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}}

            Remember: Each resource must sum to exactly 3 units across both agents.<|eot_id|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

            Agent 1: Hi, Agent 2: Hi! 🙂, Agent 1: So what are you thinking about how we should split this? i really want firewood, as i am anemic and have a hard time in the cold weather during the nights here, Agent 2: Well, I need to keep some firewood for myself too, since it'd be cold outside. But I'm willing to trade more of it for food, since I'm iron-defcient and have family to feed!🙂, Agent 1: fair enough, how do you want to split the water
