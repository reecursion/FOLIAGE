You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hi there, good to connect with you. How are you today?, Agent 2: I am good, thank you.  What are your preferences? I really need the extra food packages.  We are doing a lot of hiking and mountain biking and there are no grocery stores for at least 50 miles.🙂, Agent 1: Oh wow that is quite a lot of hiking! I think we will be hanging out a lot overnight and so I am looking for more firewood if possible. My kids can't hike very far and want to do more with smores and marshmellows., Agent 2: I can work with that.  I am willing to give you all of the firewood.  We are in a hot climate and won't need too much.  Being in a hot climate and with a lot of exercise, I am hoping to take the three water packages., Agent 1: Thank you for that. I'm happy to give you the food packages as well as we shouldn't need extras. Being around the fire, we are going to be hot as well and dehydrated. I say let's try and split the waters., Agent 2: We are going to be in an area where there is little potable water.  I don't have a water filter either.  The extra water will be very important for our group., [Summary: The conversation begins with a friendly exchange, with both participants expressing their needs and preferences for resources. Initially, there is a cooperative tone as they discuss their respective situations. As the conversation progresses, mturk_agent_1 proposes a compromise, suggesting a split of resources. However, mturk_agent_2 emphasizes the necessity of water for their group, indicating a shift towards a more assertive stance to ensure their needs are met. The dialogue reflects a balance between cooperation and negotiation.]

As in everything ?, Agent 2: I was more thinking 2 Firewood for me , 1 food and 1 water? The rest would be yours., Agent 1: That is a promising bargain but I want at least 2 firewood, it makes for a fun time for my group., Agent 2: Interesting , because my group feels the same way though.
