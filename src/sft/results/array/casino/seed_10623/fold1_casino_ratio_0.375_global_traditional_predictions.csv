            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hi we would like you to consider giving us all of the rations for the trip., Agent 1: hello, that could be a good idea, but I think I need more rations, Agent 2: How important are they to you?
