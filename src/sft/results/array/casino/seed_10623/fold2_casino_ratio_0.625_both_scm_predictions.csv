Thank you for understanding my issues. 🙂, Agent 2: I definitely need the food the most. I'm definitely not a ""hunter"", so if I were to run out, I'd be in pretty sad shape. I do need the firewood for both cooking, and keeping warm. It gets cold at night where we're going. How about youself? , [Summary: user1:
