            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 2: I think we'll both need each of the three items, but we can't split them evenly. How about I take 2 waters, 2 firewoods, and a food. You can have two food packages, a water, and a firewood., Agent 1: hi bro, 2 water for 2 firewood 1 food for me, Agent 2: Do you need the extra water? I get super thirsty and I'd be willing to give up another firewood to get an extra water, while we still get at least one of each., Agent 1: bro pls givene me two water for me,, [Summary: The conversation begins with one speaker proposing a distribution of items that seems equitable but not entirely equal. The second speaker responds with a counteroffer, prioritizing their need for water. The first speaker then attempts to negotiate further, expressing a strong personal need for water and offering a trade to accommodate this.
