You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hello, I'm going camping today and I can't wait!, Agent 2: Nice, so are we!, Agent 1: That is awesome! The one bad thing about my campsite is there's no stream or lake nearby. I'm going to need a lot of it so I can shower/wash up , [Summary: The conversation begins with excitement and anticipation as both speakers share their plans for camping. The initial enthusiasm is mutual, creating a sense of camaraderie. However, the first speaker introduces a practical concern about the lack of water at their campsite, which slightly shifts the tone from purely enthusiastic to a more pragmatic consideration of camping logistics. Despite this, the overall mood remains positive and focused on the upcoming experience.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 2: Hi  I have an extra guest that will be camping with me and was wondering if you had an extra food package that you could spare?, Agent 1: I don't have much food, but you can take one package and I can take two?, Agent 2: thanks  that would be great!  I also need an extra package of firewood, I will probably need it cooking.  Do you have a spare package of it as well?, Agent 1: I don't need much firework, so you could have two packages. Could I take all of the water so I can wash my clothes?, [Summary: The conversation begins with one speaker requesting additional resources due to an unexpected guest. The other speaker responds cooperatively, offering a compromise on food distribution. As the conversation progresses, the first speaker requests more resources, this time firewood, and the second speaker continues to accommodate by offering more than initially requested. The second speaker then makes a request for water, suggesting a reciprocal exchange and maintaining a collaborative tone throughout the interaction.]

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: I am running low on firewood. I need more to keep the fire going and cook food., Agent 2: Yeah I need firewood too. It's only 50 degrees at night on the mountain, even in the summer., Agent 1: How would you feel about giving me some firewood for food? , [Summary: The conversation begins with both participants expressing a shared concern about their dwindling firewood supply. Initially, they establish a common need for warmth and cooking. As the dialogue progresses, one participant shifts towards a collaborative approach, proposing a barter system by offering food in exchange for firewood. This indicates a move from merely sharing concerns to actively seeking a mutually beneficial solution, reflecting a cooperative and problem-solving sentiment.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:
