I am worried about having enough water though, are you short on any supplies?, Agent 2: I think I'm good. I'm not 100% sure. My husband likes to do adventures on the fly. He got these water filter straw thingies from Amazon and said that if we run out of the water I packed, that we can drink the water in the lake but I don't really trust the straws., Agent 1: Sounds like you need water too. How about you take 2 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood?, Agent 2: I don't know, you said you're worried about having enough water too. I'm excited to make campfires though!
