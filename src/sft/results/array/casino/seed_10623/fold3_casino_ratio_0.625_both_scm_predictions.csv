            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hi there, I really need some water because I don't have enough to get by, Agent 2: Good afternoon. Ok, water is a medium need for me. I have some to get by. I really need firewood. It's cold., Agent 1: I'd be willing to give up all the firewood in exchange for the water. I also am low on Food and would need at least 2., Agent 2: That doesn't sound like something I can agree to. Do you have any other ideas?, Agent 1: I can keep 2 of the firewood then and offer you 2 of the food. I'd take the water, 2 firewood and 1 water, Agent 2: I would do 3 firewood, 2 water and 2 food., Agent 1: I can't do that. Truth is I need the firewood and I was hoping you didn't need it. I propose I keep 1 firewood, 3 waters and 2 food and you take the rest?, Agent 2: I would do this instead: 3 firewood, 1 water and 2 food., Agent 1: That's not going to be a fair offer, you'll need to do better than that or I don't think we can come to an agreement , [Summary: user1:

            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: It's been so cold these last few days, I'm worried that I didn't bring enough wood for the next few nights., Agent 2: That is unfortunate.

You seem to want firewood. How about you suggest something., Agent 1: That's a good idea.Let me think. How about 3 Firewood, 1 Food and 2 waters for me. , [Summary: user1:

If your children are dehydrated and disoriented, perhaps you should get them to emergency care immediately.  I would like to provide you will all of the water in the meantime, but that would leave me with none at all.  I wouldn't have your husband out of the tent with chills.
