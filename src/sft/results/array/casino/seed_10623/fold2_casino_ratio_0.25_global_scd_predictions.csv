You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: I would like all the firewood and two packages of water. You can have the rest.🙂, Agent 2: I want all of the water, two firewood, and one food., Agent 1: Why do you need all the water and little food? , [Summary: The conversation begins with mturk_agent_1 making an offer with a friendly tone, suggesting a division of resources. mturk_agent_2 responds with a counter-offer, expressing a desire for more water and some food. mturk_agent_1 then questions mturk_agent_2's needs, indicating a shift towards seeking clarification or justification for the proposed allocation, which suggests a move from initial generosity to a more inquisitive and possibly negotiating stance.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:
