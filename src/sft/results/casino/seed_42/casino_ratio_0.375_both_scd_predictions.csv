You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hello! üôÇ Let's work together on a deal for these packages, shall we? What are you most interested in?, Agent 2: Hey! I'd like some more firewood to keep my doggo warm.

The exchange remains cordial, with both parties open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.]
