You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: I am so excited to go camping!  I am planning a nice long walk in the woods to decompress from the hectic days of working., Agent 1: I am too.  I've been thinking of this since COVID.  I hear we have some materials to share between the two of us.  What are you thinking?  For me, I am from the South so I get cold easily 🙂 so firewood is my main priority.

            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: HI. I'd love to get 2 additional packs of firewood. The weather forecast was for much warmer weather here and I just didn't bring enough with me. I also left my additional sweatshirt at home. I'd be happy to give you one additional water and two of food.  🙂🙂, Agent 1: Well I had a really great day fishing today and I would like to have some extra firewood so I can cook all of this fish.  How about I take the 3 packages of firewood and you can keep 2 additional food packages in return., Agent 2: You really did have a good day didn't you! Sounds like fun. How many fish can one person eat? If I don't have the extra firewood I'm going to be really cold tonight. ☹️, Agent 1: I am here with my family and we love to eat fish.🙂  Maybe if you spend tonight sleeping in your car or camper I can keep the fire wood. In exchange I will give you the 2 additional food packages and all 3 of the water packages. It's only for 1 night.

            Agent 1: Hello, how are you doing today?, Agent 2: Very good. How about you?, Agent 1: I'm doing well. I'm looking forward to going on my camping trip but will need some additional items to make sure the trip is safe, healthy, and enjoyable., Agent 2: Same here., Agent 1: I have diabetes, so it is very important to me that I get extra packages of water and food.
