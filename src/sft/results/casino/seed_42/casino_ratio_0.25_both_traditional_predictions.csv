You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hi, this is my first time camping and I want to make sure I have enough stuff.  I would like three food, three firewood, and two water.  What do you think?, Agent 2: I have been camping a few times and pretty much know what I need to be comfortable and healthy.  Warmth and hydration are important for me.

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation with intentions:
            Agent 1: Hi, I'm hoping we can come to a nice deal. üôÇ I'm most interested in firewood, because it always helps to have extra if your fire goes out., Agent 2: That makes sense. I'm also interested in firewood, but have a great need for water due to the current weather. , [Summary: Two participants are negotiating a deal. Agent 1 is primarily interested in acquiring firewood, while Agent 2 also wants firewood but has a pressing need for water due to the weather.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:
