How about you?, Agent 1: I could use water, too, but I'd be willing to give some up if you give me more items overall, Agent 2: What is your priority item to get the division started?, Agent 1: I would propose that I get 1 water, 1 food and 3 firewood and you would get 2 water and 2 food, Agent 2: I don't mind the division but I would like a pack of firewood added because my family of 7 consume this item as well during the day & night, Agent 1: you would have to give more items up to get firewood. if you get more water, which is our highest item, i need more of other items, Agent 2: How about 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood?, Agent 1: I don't really need food, to be honest. Food is the least of my worries.

You're going to need extra water for your family to drink. All the sodium in the fish is going to make you all thirsty!, Agent 1: Your right,üòÆ  I didn't think about that. But will probably only need 1 extra package of water so, in exchange I will offer you 1 package of firewood., Agent 2: I know this isn't your problem, but I'm a student and I had to come up here to take photos of the night sky for my astronomy class.

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hello, how are you doing today?, Agent 2: Very good. How about you?, Agent 1: I'm doing well. I'm looking forward to going on my camping trip but will need some additional items to make sure the trip is safe, healthy, and enjoyable., Agent 2: Same here., Agent 1: I have diabetes, so it is very important to me that I get extra packages of water and food. When I'm at home, I always need to pack extra drinks and snacks for myself in case I go into shock and need to take medication. The trip could be very dangerous for me if I don't have access to these additional supplies., Agent 2: Actually mine own purposeful need is firewood and water. Being on a first time adventure, I lack these items as I was inadequately prepared., Agent 1: Okay, so firewood and water are your two most pressing needs?, Agent 2: Yes., Agent 1: Okay. I'm willing to give in on the firewood, but I really can't give in on the water or the food. As a diabetic I have to put my health first., Agent 2: I can give out the food in exchange for the firewood, Agent 1: Okay. I need all of the water, if you're getting the firewood., Agent 2: I can't give out all the water. I need to be hydrated as well., Agent 1: You already have all the basics, though, so you won't lack sufficient water to be hydrated. I have a serious medical condition that requires that I have access to additional water.

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hi! Which items are important to you?, Agent 1: Food is the most important to me because I need to eat more often so that I can take my medications., Agent 2: Yeah, that is important. I do not have a problem letting you have more food than me., Agent 1: Would it be possible to get an extra water also?  How do you feel about the firewood?  I wish we could split everything evenly.üôÇ, Agent 2: Me too. Firewood is the most important thing to me. We will be somewhere cold and we could use the extra warmth., Agent 1: True.  How about I get 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood. And that will leave you with 2 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food?

I'm going on a 3 week trip to this gorgeous lake., Agent 1: Wow, 3 weeks is a long camping trip! I don't know if I have enough supplies to go for a trip that long. Are you doing a cabin-style or really roughing it? My husband and son want to do a lot of hiking so we're thinking of moving camp daily., Agent 2: that's awesome! I know, I'm a little worried about my food supplies but I think I can figure everything else out. No, we're roughing it, my boyfriend's huge on camping., Agent 1: Lol, at least it sounds like you've got an expert with you. My husband is really gung-ho but he tends to fly by the edge of his seat when it comes to stuff like planning. He's says he wants to travel light and that he got these water filter straws so that we could drink lake water but I'm super sketched out... I don't want us getting something like schistosomiasis. And I want to make sure everyone stays hydrated with all of the hiking they want to do, Agent 2: I get that. I'm going to risk it with the lake water because I'd personally love to have enough food to last 3 weeks (which I'm a little worried about as it is), so I can definitely help you out with the water.

            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: I need all thefirewood and food, you can have all the water., Agent 2: Sorry, that can't work for me. Is there a reason you need all the firewood and food?, Agent 1: I have health issues, and I need to keep warm at night.  And I don't know how much fish I can catch., Agent 2: Okay, that makes sense. But I also need to keep warm., Agent 1: I think I can get by with 2 firewood, and give you 1., Agent 2: Hmm, I think I need firewood more than anything else. Would you take 1 firewood and 2 food?, Agent 1: If I do that, I will need all the food, since I won't be able to cook much fish., Agent 2: I see. I do need at least 1 food package because I will be spending lots of calories working. But I can give you all the water.

Good idea to check supplies!, Agent 2: We're nearly there and just realized that we must have missed picking up some of our stuff before leaving., Agent 1: Were we supposed to bring things?  Oh, no!  I'm gonna die..., Agent 2: Of course, it's always wise to bring things. We absolutely need water and some food. Water is critical though.

            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hi, I would like all of the water and 2 food packages. You can have all of the firewood and one food package. Does that sound good?, Agent 1: Nice to meet you! I definitely like the idea of having all of the firewood, but water is very important to me. Let's see if we can come to and agreement on how to split up the water., Agent 2: I typically drink a lot of water every day. So I can't agree with much less on that!, Agent 1: Alright, I'm sure we can something that works for both of us. The location I'm camping in is only accessible by foot, so I anticipate that I'll need a little more water than normal to feel completely safe. Is there any water source nearby your campsite?, Agent 2: Nothing that I would trust. Additionally, I have a dog that will need water as well., Agent 1: Oh well that is something to consider. I love dogs. üôÇ. I'd be willing to take less in that case, and let you have 2 of the waters. Would you be OK with leaving me with 1? I'd be willing to split the food up the same way (you get 2, I get 1).
