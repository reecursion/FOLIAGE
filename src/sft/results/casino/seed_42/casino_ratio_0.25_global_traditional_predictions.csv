            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: hi there üôÇ, Agent 1: Hallo, how are you doing? , [Summary: Two participants, mturk_agent_2 and mturk_agent_1, are greeting each other. Mturk_agent_2 starts with a friendly ""hi there,"" and mturk_agent_1 responds with ""Hallo"" and asks how mturk_agent_2 is doing.]

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            OUTCOME: {agent1:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}, agent2:{food:[number], water:[number], firewood:[number]}}

            Remember: Each resource must sum to exactly 3 units across both agents.<|eot_id|>","<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
