            Agent 1: Hi, I am looking at extra items for my camping trip and would like to have 3 firewoods, 3 foods and 2 waters., Agent 2: Hey, I am excited to go camping too!  Would you mind sharing your top priority items with me so that we can come up with a fair deal?  Ideally I would love 3 firewoods, 3 foods, and 2 waters just like you aha.  But perhaps we can each get at least 3 packages of our highest priority item, Agent 1: Hmmm, I think I really need the firewood.  I brought softwoods and they burn out quickly so I don't think I'll have enough wood to keep me going through the night. I get kinda scared without the fire.  What is your priority?
