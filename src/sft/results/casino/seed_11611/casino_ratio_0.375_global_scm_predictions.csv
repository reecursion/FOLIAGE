You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hey! For the camping trip it would be awesome if I could have 3 packages of food. My friend is gluten and dairy free and we need as many options as possible for her., Agent 2: Aww I'm sorry to hear that, it sounds like it might be better to have her bring her own food. I'll be bringing my teenage son so it would be awesome to get any extra food for him that I can. You know how they be! 🙂, Agent 1: What about I take 2 of the packages and you take 1? I know teenagers also drink a lot of water haha 🙂 , [Summary: user1:
  warmth: high
  competence: high
  explanation: User1 demonstrates high warmth by expressing concern for their friend's dietary needs and suggesting a compromise. Their competence is high as they propose a practical solution to share resources fairly.

user2:
  warmth: high
  competence: low
  explanation: User2 shows high warmth by expressing empathy and humor in response to user1's situation. However, their competence is low as they suggest a less practical solution by implying user1's friend should bring her own food, which doesn't address the shared resource issue effectively.]
