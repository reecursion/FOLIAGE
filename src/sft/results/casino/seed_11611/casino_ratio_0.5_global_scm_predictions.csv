            Agent 2: Hello, I want to keep 3 packages of the water and 2 packages of the food and 1 package of the fire wood, and you can keep 1 package of the food and 2 packages of the firewood., Agent 1: Could I get 1 package of the water just to be entirely safe?? I really appreciate the 2 packages of firewood as it has been very wet and rainy where I will be going.  There will be a lot of standing water, so my chances for having safe water to drink might be a little iffy., Agent 2: Well I planned on spending a few extra days here at this camping site with my family so the extra water will really come in handy for me over the next few days.  I can offer you an extra package of firewood to keep the 3 packages of water., Agent 1: That makes total sense.  I will let you keep all 3 of the water packages.  If I take the extra firewood for all 3 packages then I can probably boil a lot of the water to get the harmful bacteria out.  I really appreciate your generosity 🙂., Agent 2: No problem.🙂  So I will keep the 3 packages of water and, since I am giving you all 3 packages of the firewood I will take back the 1 food package and keep all 3 of the food packages., [Summary: user1:

I am a little worried about water though, there aren't any sources of water where we are going. Hmm.. , [Summary: user1 (mturk_agent_1):

Have a lot of extra people., Agent 2: Awesome - same, I also need a ton of food. Will firewood be of interest to you as well? I'll be happy to compensate in this way, Agent 1: Firewood is not overly interesting to me, but water is somewhat enticing., Agent 2: Ok, great - I can give you all of my waters in exchange for a majority of the food and half of firewood, Agent 1: Half of firewood? There are 3 so one of us has to get more. I would need more of that., Agent 2: Yep, I know there's three and no way to split evenly lol - can you give me a justifiable reason as to why you deserve more over me?
