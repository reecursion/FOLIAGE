You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hi, I'd like 3 packages of food. I have diabetes and my blood sugar could drop., Agent 1: oh dear, I am sorry to hear that my son is type one, I am okay with giving you all the food if you could give me all the firewood. I have hypothyroidism and it makes me get cold., Agent 2: That's a deal., Agent 1: now how to split the water, wish it wasn't an odd number, Agent 2: I'll take 1 and you can have 2 since you gave me all the food.

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:

            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: food, Low priority: water

            Agent 2: Hi, it is nice to be going camping. I do not have a very good sleeping bag and I can get cold at night. It would be nice to have extra firewood. I dont eat much so I do not need much extra food. Would you be willing to give me two packages of firewood for a package of food?, Agent 1: I enjoy camping as well. However, my campsite seems to be a bit chilly at night. I'd be willing to part with some firewood, yet I'd need quite a bit of food to compensate. I also have a stream nearby so water is plentiful if you need that as well., Agent 2: I may be able to do something with regards to food. Do you have enough water?, Agent 1: I have more water than I need. How is your water supply?, Agent 2: I could use some more water as I get dehydrated easily. Since you have enough, I could give you and extra package of food for your water.

I'm happy to give you the food packages as well as we shouldn't need extras. Being around the fire, we are going to be hot as well and dehydrated. I say let's try and split the waters., Agent 2: We are going to be in an area where there is little potable water.  I don't have a water filter either.

            Agent 1: High priority: firewood, Medium priority: water, Low priority: food
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 1: Hi there, good to connect with you. How are you today?, Agent 2: I am good, thank you.  What are your preferences? I really need the extra food packages.  We are doing a lot of hiking and mountain biking and there are no grocery stores for at least 50 miles.🙂, Agent 1: Oh wow that is quite a lot of hiking! I think we will be hanging out a lot overnight and so I am looking for more firewood if possible. My kids can't hike very far and want to do more with smores and marshmellows., Agent 2: I can work with that.  I am willing to give you all of the firewood.  We are in a hot climate and won't need too much.  Being in a hot climate and with a lot of exercise, I am hoping to take the three water packages., Agent 1: Thank you for that. I'm happy to give you the food packages as well as we shouldn't need extras. Being around the fire, we are going to be hot as well and dehydrated. I say let's try and split the waters., Agent 2: We are going to be in an area where there is little potable water.  I don't have a water filter either.  The extra water will be very important for our group.

I really appreciate the 2 packages of firewood as it has been very wet and rainy where I will be going.  There will be a lot of standing water, so my chances for having safe water to drink might be a little iffy., Agent 2: Well I planned on spending a few extra days here at this camping site with my family so the extra water will really come in handy for me over the next few days.  I can offer you an extra package of firewood to keep the 3 packages of water., Agent 1: That makes total sense.  I will let you keep all 3 of the water packages.  If I take the extra firewood for all 3 packages then I can probably boil a lot of the water to get the harmful bacteria out.  I really appreciate your generosity 🙂., Agent 2: No problem.🙂  So I will keep the 3 packages of water and, since I am giving you all 3 packages of the firewood I will take back the 1 food package and keep all 3 of the food packages.

            Agent 1: Hi, I really need water to stay hydrated during my camping trip because my food supplies are low. Do you have any to spare?, Agent 2: Hi.  I can't do that right now., Agent 1: Is there anything that you might need?, Agent 2: I would be interested in firewood.  Can I ask you, what are your primary concerns on this trip?, Agent 1: My primary concerns are staying hydrated, I have been feeling sick and throwing up from being so high up in the mountains., Agent 2: Oh, so sorry to hear that.  I can understand why water would be important to you.  I am worried about being too cold at night. My sleeping bag is not rated well for cold weather (I packed the wring one)., Agent 1: Oh I understand that for sure. I am not used to the cold weather either which is not helping. Would you be interested in a trade for water in exchange for firewood?

I am going to need a lot of wood, so I can cook the meals I am making 🙂, Agent 2: I completely understand, thank you for compromising with water and food. Wished we had 4 firewoods to divide and share it equaly, may I ask how long will you be camping for? Im afraid I need 2 firewoods as well, maybe we can see who has the greater need?, Agent 1: I am going to be camping for a couple of weeks, so I will need quite a bit. I also realized some additional water would be good, because I have some meals that need me to boil water. Maybe you can have 2 firewood in exchange for me having one of your waters?

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: food, Medium priority: water, Low priority: firewood

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hello 🙂 Hope you have a good amount of supplies for your trip!, Agent 1: Not really! I will need you to give me 3 food, 2 water and 2 firewood., Agent 2: Yea, that's not going to work for me. That would leave me with NO food, and only 1 water, and 1 firewood. Would you take that deal, if I offered it back to you?, Agent 1: Ok what will work for you?, Agent 2: I really need at least some of everything. What do you need the most?, Agent 1: I think we are now talking. I need food the most and water as the second priority.

You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: water, Medium priority: food, Low priority: firewood
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hello!  I've been super thirsty and as a result I was wondering if I could get all 3 packages of water?, Agent 1: I like to hike and will need additional water. Can I take one package and you can have the other two?, Agent 2: That sounds good to me.  Do you have any kind of preference for firewood or food?, Agent 1: I would need additional food to sustain my energy for my hikes. Do you mind if I take two packages of the food? What are your thoughts?, Agent 2: That sounds good to me.

            Based on this negotiation, predict the final allocation of resources. Provide only your answer using the following format with curly braces, with no explanation:
