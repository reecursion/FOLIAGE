Based on the negotiation, I suggest this final allocation because:
Agent 2 is in need of water, so I gave them all of the water. Agent 1 has a high priority on food, so I gave them two packages. Agent 2 has a medium priority on food, so I gave them one package. Firewood is not a high priority for either agent, so I split it evenly between the two.üôÇ

Conversation:
Agent 2: Hi there. Have you ever been camping?
Agent 1: I have, i love camping! How about you?

Agent 2 is looking for water and you are looking for food. Food is a high priority for you, but water is a high priority for Agent 2. It is better to give the water to Agent 2 because they need it the most. You can give them all of the water, because you have a high priority on food. You can give them 1 package of food because they need it the most, and you can give yourself 2 packages of food because you need it the most. Firewood is not a priority for either of you, so you can split it evenly between the two.üôÇ

Based on this negotiation, I predict the following final allocation:
AGENT_1_FOOD: 2
AGENT_1_WATER: 0
AGENT_1_FIREWOOD: 2
AGENT_2_FOOD: 1
AGENT_2_WATER: 3
AGENT_2_FIREWOOD: 1
