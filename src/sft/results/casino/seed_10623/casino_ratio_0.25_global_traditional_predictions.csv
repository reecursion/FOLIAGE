You are helping analyze a negotiation conversation where two agents are discussing the allocation of resources. Each resource has exactly three units that must be divided between the two agents. The total amount of each resource allocated to both agents must add up to three. 

            Agent Preferences:
            Agent 1: High priority: food, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: water
            Agent 2: High priority: water, Medium priority: firewood, Low priority: food

            Conversation:
            Agent 2: Hello, I would really like to get most of the water and firewood packages., Agent 1: You can have most of the water and firewood if I can have most of the food.
