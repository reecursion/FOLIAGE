casino,594,3,mturk_agent_2,train,"I need a lot of food, because of how many people are coming now (like 3 times as many).

We are in a forest though, so we should be good for wood. Since you can easily fish, what if I take 3 food and 2 water? You can keep all the firewood. 🙂",Explaining the need for more food and water due to additional people and suggesting an alternative distribution.

Yeah, if any of us knew how to fish or forage, we wouldn't need as much, but we're all from the city, so our survival skills are pretty bad and we're going to be camping for almost a week.

casino,502,5,mturk_agent_2,train,Ugh ☹️ I too could really use the firewood. We need that campfire going all night to be able to socialize. How about water? Do you have enough? Do you need more?,Express a similar need and inquire about another potential need

casino,502,8,mturk_agent_1,train,I see. How about you get 2 firewood 1 water 1 food. And I get 1 firewod 2 water 2 food?,Adjust the trade proposal to find a mutually beneficial solution

casino,545,1,mturk_agent_2,train,"Hi there.. I'm sorry, I didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages, I believe.  So, here's the situation.. I think I can get by with less firewood as I'm a Floridian and prefer it cooler anyway.. also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but I'm definitely interested in as much water as possible.. both for cooking and cleaning purposes, as well as drinking, of course.  🙂",Explain their needs and preferences in detail
casino,545,2,mturk_agent_1,train,okay so what do you suggest,Request a suggestion for the deal
casino,545,3,mturk_agent_2,train,"Well, I recognize you're gonna need water too.. so I'd love to take 2 of them, giving you one and I'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food.. that way we all ensure we have enough.. you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but I think its best for both of us 🙂",Propose a specific distribution of resources
casino,545,4,mturk_agent_1,train,i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods,Counter-propose a different distribution
casino,545,5,mturk_agent_2,train,"Yeah, sorry, that's not going to work out for me.

casino,545,6,mturk_agent_1,train,but thats the only offer im willing to give,State unwillingness to change the offer
casino,545,7,mturk_agent_2,train,Well then unfortunately I think we're gonna have to walk away from this and neither of us gets anything we could both use.. that's unfortunate and I'm sorry to see it end in such a less than magnanimous fashion ☹️,Express regret and indicate a potential end to negotiations
casino,545,8,mturk_agent_1,train,you need water and i need food so unless we do 1 food  to 1water is tht okay,Propose a simplified trade focusing on essential needs
casino,545,9,mturk_agent_2,train,"I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.. I can't really budge on the water.. BUT.. I could do something where I take 2 water, and only one firewood, but two food.. does that work for you?",Offer a compromise with a slight adjustment
casino,545,10,mturk_agent_1,train,so if i were to  give you water what would i get ?,Seek clarification on what they would receive in return
casino,545,11,mturk_agent_2,train,"You'd be getting 1 water, 2 firewood, and 1 food",Clarify the proposed exchange

casino,545,14,mturk_agent_1,train,no its not i give you i water i get 1 food and 1 firewood,Reject the reiterated offer and propose a simpler trade
casino,545,15,mturk_agent_2,train,"We only have 3 of each to divide up.. so yes, you're going to have to give me one more on an item.. but in exchange I'm giving you 1 more on two different items.  I'm getting 4 items in total, you're getting 5.. - You're essentially netting 11% more 'items' than I am in this deal.",Explain the fairness of the original offer in detail
casino,545,16,mturk_agent_1,train,thats the point as you need water so badly,Emphasize the importance of water to the other party
casino,545,17,mturk_agent_2,train,Correct.. I do.. but if you're not willing to budge on this where you're still netting more overall value I understand - I'm bummed but I understand.,Acknowledge the importance of water and express understanding
casino,545,18,mturk_agent_1,train,im contented with  what i have but im willing to trade as yu need more water so i need t make a profit,State contentment with current resources but willingness to trade for profit
casino,545,19,mturk_agent_2,train,"That's unfortunate then as instead of making a tiny bit less of a profit now you're not going to make any because you would rather give up the deal.  Also, if you do the math, you'll see that I'm actually benefiting you here - I understand, though.  I can put through the offer and hope you change your mind so we both benefit.",Express disappointment and attempt to persuade with logical reasoning

What are your preferences.,Sharing a personal connection to Puget Sound and discussing logistical needs for the trip.
casino,595,4,mturk_agent_2,train,"I was definitely looking to have food and firewood most of all.

casino,595,5,mturk_agent_1,train,"😮 I see.  I am wiling to give you the firewood, but I also really need the food.  I could take the waters and two food, and how about if you take the firewood and 1 food? The firewood would be helpful since we need to cook a lot of our food and there is not much to collect in the desert, but if we can take extra food, then it will help solve that problem.🙂",Proposing a trade and explaining the rationale behind the offer.
casino,595,6,mturk_agent_2,train,I think that would work for us!,Agreeing to the proposed trade.
casino,595,7,mturk_agent_1,train,I am willing to make that deal.,Confirming the agreement.

casino,137,3,mturk_agent_1,train,I would really like 2 water and 2 firewood and 1 food.,State specific preferences for the packages
casino,137,4,mturk_agent_2,train,I would like 3 water no firewood and 2 food. I have 8 people in my family and I have a medical condition where I can only drink water and have to drink 100 ounces per day.,Express own preferences and provide context for the needs

casino,137,6,mturk_agent_2,train,"Well that is going to be a problem then because I have a medical condition too. How can we meet in the middle? I get 2 water, 2 food and no firewood?",Acknowledge the conflict and propose a compromise
casino,137,7,mturk_agent_1,train,"I really need that water. I'm going camping in the desert where firewood will be vital for me as well. How about I take 2 water, 2 firewood and you get 1 water, 1 firewood and all the extra food?",Reiterate the importance of water and firewood  and propose an alternative compromise
casino,137,8,mturk_agent_2,train,That works. Deal🙂,Agree to the proposed compromise and confirm the deal
casino,137,9,mturk_agent_1,train,Sounds good. It was nice working with you. 🙂,Express satisfaction with the agreement and conclude the conversation on a positive note

casino,465,1,mturk_agent_1,train,I have circulatory issued due to a heart condition and cold quickly. I would appreciate if I could get at least 2 of the firewood. You can have 2 of the food so you won't get hungry. 🙂,Express personal needs and propose an alternative distribution.
casino,465,2,mturk_agent_2,train,"I was planning on building a big bonfire for the evening.  There'd be plenty of room if you wanted to join for warmth.  I'm a bit hungry and would appreciate the extra food.  You can have all of the water if you'd like.  If you warm it by the bonfire, it may be useful to soak in to improve your circulation.",Justify initial proposal and offer a compromise.
casino,465,3,mturk_agent_1,train,I get tired to easy so I probably won't be much fun at a bonfire ☹️. I really do appreciate the offer though. I would think the extra food would do you more good for your party.,Decline the offer and reinforce the need for firewood.
casino,465,4,mturk_agent_2,train,"The extra food would be appreciated.  How about if I take just two each of the firewood and food, and you can have the remainder, plus all of the water?",Propose a revised distribution plan.
casino,465,5,mturk_agent_1,train,I am just concerned that only 1 firewood might make it so I'm too cold to function.,Express concern about the revised plan.
casino,465,6,mturk_agent_2,train,"If you boil the water above the fire, it will provide additional heat over time.  You would also be able to make tea, which would warm you up from the inside as well, better than any fire would.  That would probably be most beneficial to you.  I really do need the 2 firewood if there's any chance of making a bonfire for my party.",Provide a solution to the concern and justify the need for firewood.
casino,465,7,mturk_agent_1,train,I am allergic to tea and coffee. I wonder if the smaller fire would be more quaint for everyone to sit around.,Express inability to use the proposed solution and suggest an alternative.
casino,465,8,mturk_agent_2,train,"It really wouldn't do the job that well at all.  You could always prepare hot cocoa or use your share of the food to make a warm stew.  I really do need at least the two firewood and a couple of food.  You can have all the water to make a hearty and hot stew to get your through the night, though.",Reject the alternative and propose another solution.
casino,465,9,mturk_agent_1,train,I can't eat much anyway because of the health issues. You could have all of the food if I could get the extra firewood. That would still give you an extra firewood in addition to the basic supply and lots of extra food for your party. I'm sure they would love having some of the stew you mentioned.,Offer a new proposal that addresses both parties' needs.
casino,465,10,mturk_agent_2,train,"Well, how about I take just the one extra firewood, plus all of the food, and one of the water so that I can make stew?  Would that work for you?",Propose a final compromise.
casino,465,11,mturk_agent_1,train,That sounds good. I hope your party is wonderful.,Agree to the final compromise and express goodwill.

casino,591,8,mturk_agent_1,train,This also sounds like a fair deal to me! I am happy that we have reached a compromise so quickly on the packages based on our needs!,Expressing satisfaction with the reached compromise and acknowledging the quick resolution.
casino,591,9,mturk_agent_2,train,Me as well! I'm glad we could come to such a comprimise.,Expressing mutual satisfaction with the compromise.

casino,2,2,mturk_agent_2,train,"I am very excited, I'm actually going camping in a week. I drink a lot of water so it's important that I bring a lot. What about you?",Sharing personal excitement and discussing preparations
casino,2,3,mturk_agent_1,train,"I really am! I have been watching the weather and updates about the area I will be traveling to.  They are experiencing a severe drought, so I will be in need of some extra water as well! I planned on staying an extra couple days as well.  There is a stream nearby I believe, but I'm not sure how much it has dried up.",Expressing excitement and sharing detailed plans and concerns
casino,2,4,mturk_agent_2,train,"That's good to hear, you always have to be careful with wild water though, it has all kind of germs. Sounds like you'll have plenty of dry firewood though.",Offering advice and making an observation
casino,2,5,mturk_agent_1,train,"Yes, I would be willing to let you have all the firewood for 2 of the cases of water.  How much food were you needing?",Proposing a trade and inquiring about needs
casino,2,6,mturk_agent_2,train,I like your water and firewood arrangement. Can I have 2 of the food since you're getting 2 of the water?,Agreeing to the trade and making a counter-proposal
casino,2,7,mturk_agent_1,train,Let me think on that. I know there won't be much for berries or small animals to hunt for.  Is where you are going have much available for you to hunt and scavenge for?,Considering the counter-proposal and inquiring about the other person's situation
casino,2,8,mturk_agent_2,train,It might but with the summer season hunting isn't exactly legal at the moment. I tend to camp in remote areas so going to the store for more food isn't really an option. I've already let you have extra water so I don't think it's too far of a stretch to let me have some extra food.,Explaining limitations and justifying the counter-proposal
casino,2,9,mturk_agent_1,train,"Okay, I can let you have 2 of the food then.  I do appreciate your generosity on the extra water.",Agreeing to the counter-proposal and expressing gratitude
casino,462,0,mturk_agent_1,train,hi,Initiate conversation

casino,462,3,mturk_agent_2,train,Let's talk about how we can split the camping supplies,Introduce the topic of discussion (splitting camping supplies)
casino,462,4,mturk_agent_1,train,Ok I think we should split evenly,Agree to the proposed topic and suggest an even split
casino,462,5,mturk_agent_2,train,"yes we should come to a fair deal, what are your priority items?",Agree with the principle of fairness and ask for priority items
casino,462,6,mturk_agent_1,train,"Food is highest, firewood is medium, and water lowest. You?",State personal priority items and inquire about the other person's priorities
casino,462,7,mturk_agent_2,train,"I have food, water and firewood.",State personal priority items
casino,462,8,mturk_agent_1,train,Ok so whoever gets more wood should get something else higher,Suggest a principle for fair distribution based on priority
casino,462,9,mturk_agent_2,train,"How bout this deal, me - 3 water, 2 firewood, you 3 food, 1 firewood",Propose a specific deal for splitting the supplies
casino,462,10,mturk_agent_1,train,Sounds alright,Express agreement with the proposed deal

casino,505,4,mturk_agent_1,train,"food, then water, then firewood, and yours?",Stating preferences and asking for the other’s preferences
casino,505,5,mturk_agent_2,train,"water, food then firewood. It's really hot so I need to make sure we are hydrated. We forgot a bag of supplies that had mostly food so we really could use food. It's hot so firewood isn't necessary. If anything we can get it from around or on a hike.",Stating preferences and explaining reasoning
casino,505,6,mturk_agent_1,train,"of course, we should help one another, we will figure something out i'm sure",Expressing willingness to cooperate
casino,505,7,mturk_agent_2,train,"Yes, I think we can. I'm thinking 3 water, 2 food and 1 firewood for myself? How does that sound to you?",Proposing a distribution of supplies
casino,505,8,mturk_agent_1,train,"i can't agree to that, the best i can do is 2water 1 food and 2 firewood for you, i have to have supplies too",Rejecting proposal and making a counteroffer
casino,505,9,mturk_agent_2,train,Could I trade one firewood for another food?,Requesting a trade
casino,505,10,mturk_agent_1,train,"no, food is the top priority for me",Rejecting the trade request and reiterating priority

casino,601,3,mturk_agent_1,train,I really need food and firewood. Could you do 3 firewood and 3 food packages? My son has a problem with poor sugar levels which cause him to convulse when cold and doesn't eat enough food.,Expressing a critical need for food and firewood due to a family health issue and making a specific request
casino,601,4,mturk_agent_2,train,"Unfortunately, we have some dietary restrictions of our own with my youngest and her Type 2 diabetes.  The firewood is pretty crucial to our plans, though I might have some wiggle room on the food.",Explaining their own dietary restrictions and emphasizing the importance of firewood while showing some flexibility on food
casino,601,5,mturk_agent_1,train,I might need to walk away.,Expressing frustration and considering ending the negotiation
casino,601,6,mturk_agent_2,train,That seems like a pretty extreme move.  Supply and demand is always an issue. What do you plan to offer by way of a compromise?,Questioning the extreme reaction and asking for a compromise proposal
casino,601,7,mturk_agent_1,train,"If you give me 3 firewood, I'll give you 2 firewood and we can split the water. That's about where I'm at.",Proposing a specific trade arrangement
casino,601,8,mturk_agent_2,train,"I don't think we can split three firewood into five unless it was a typo?   I could give you 1 firewood, 2 food since I know how crucial this is for your family, and 2 water.  That leaves me with 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water.",Clarifying a potential misunderstanding and making a counter-proposal
casino,601,9,mturk_agent_1,train,That's a deal.,Accepting the counter-proposal
casino,126,0,mturk_agent_2,train,Hello🙂,Greeting
casino,126,1,mturk_agent_1,train,Hi! I'm going camping soon with my family at a lake! We're looking forward to it so much since we haven't been able to get out due to Covid. Are you going camping too?,Sharing personal plans and asking a question
casino,126,2,mturk_agent_2,train,Yes! I am also going with my family. My husband and I are essential workers but his hours all got cut. I got laid off from my job for part of the time.,Sharing personal plans and providing context about their situation
casino,126,3,mturk_agent_1,train,oh man that sucks ☹️! I know Congress is currently debating all of the unemployment stuff too. Where do you plan to be going camping?,Expressing sympathy and asking a follow-up question
casino,126,4,mturk_agent_2,train,"We didn't get unemployment or a stimulus check. ☹️ We are planning a trip to Missouri, Lake of the Ozarks. Our younger children have been cooped up so long we are hoping to let them get some sun and swimming in!",Sharing more personal context and detailing camping plans
casino,126,5,mturk_agent_1,train,"That sounds nice, maybe everyone just needs some fun to stay positive about everything. We're going camping along a lake and plan to do a lot of fishing. My husband got these filtration thingies so that we can drink the lake water but I don't really trust them. This will be my kid's first ever camping trip so we're super excited to make it fun for him.",Expressing positivity and sharing more personal plans
casino,126,6,mturk_agent_2,train,"We have 7 people in our family,.. the youngest two kids have hardly been anywhere because of working. I think our camping area has those old fashioned hand pumps.☹️",Sharing more personal context and expressing concern
casino,126,7,mturk_agent_1,train,"Your two youngest kids are working? How old is everyone? If there's a lot of people, it will be easier to split up the duties and get things done. My son's 3 years old so as much as he's eager to help, there's not much he can do lol.",Clarifying a misunderstanding and asking for more details
casino,126,8,mturk_agent_2,train,"Ha Ha...no my too youngest have hardly been anywhere because of us adults working,  I have teens (17, 15), tweens (13) and littles (10, 7). We 3 boys and 3 girls. We have a 21 year old but he's in a band so h can't go. They all pitch in anytime. They eat a lot so they have to cook from scratch at home. Awww 3 is so adorable...that's when they are sure they can do and will work so hard!",Clarifying the misunderstanding and providing detailed information about their family
casino,126,9,mturk_agent_1,train,"Home cooking's the best, yumyums! We're planning on doing a lot of fishing since my son's been in love with fishing toys and is currently in love with eating fish (he hasn't gotten tired of eating it every night for dinner). We're thinking of cooking what we catch every night. Do you have any activities planned for your camping trip?",Sharing more personal plans and asking a question
casino,126,10,mturk_agent_2,train,"Fishing is so fun! 🙂 We really don't have a plan... so many people, so many opinions. If you'll be fishing and eating your catch, you'll probably need more firewood than food. And with the filters, you will need some extra water, especially for your little guy. So would you agree that you take 2 firewood packages, 1 food package and 1 extra water.",Expressing enthusiasm  providing advice  and making a suggestion
casino,491,0,mturk_agent_1,train,I would really like to have 3 waters and 3 firewood because this is my first time camping and I don't have survival skills.,Expressing a strong need for resources due to lack of survival skills
casino,491,1,mturk_agent_2,train,"You must be a comedian.  We will need to come to a compromise because there's no way that's going to happen.  I am like a water buffalo so I'll need at least two waters.  In addition, my family is from the South and will need firewood as well.",Rejecting the initial request and stating personal needs and constraints
casino,491,2,mturk_agent_1,train,I can't swim too. I think two waters will help me to survive on this trip and I will need at least two firewood to make fish or other food items for my family.,Reiterating personal needs and justifying the request
casino,491,3,mturk_agent_2,train,You don't need this water to swim.  You can take two of the food if you're worried about food.  I will take two water and two firewood since I have a large family to nourish and keep warm.  Your initial suggestion of 3  waters and firewood is laughable.  Please provide a realistic compromise.,Rejecting the revised request and proposing an alternative distribution
casino,491,4,mturk_agent_1,train,"If I take two waters, 1 firewood, and 2 food supplies, this will help me during the trip. It seems as if you are more skilled than I am on a camping trip. Please consider my request☹️",Proposing a new compromise and appealing to the other’s experience
casino,491,5,mturk_agent_2,train,"LOL - not a chance.  You're going to have to give me more than that.  I am more skilled and thus need firewood.  How about this...I will take 3 firewood and 2 food.  You can take all the water because you're so non-skilled in the wilderness. I am going to hunt for my food, but again I have a large family.  I am not considering your request  at all.  We will need to come to a decision relatively soon.",Rejecting the compromise and proposing a new distribution while emphasizing personal needs
casino,491,6,mturk_agent_1,train,"I understand your preferences. If I take all of the water, 1 firewood, and 2 food your family will still have the opportunity to have a good camping trip and I can learn to survive on this trip. Please consider my request again.☹️",Reiterating the compromise and appealing for consideration
casino,491,7,mturk_agent_2,train,"Ok - you're not being reasonable at all.  If you're so incompetent at going camping, maybe you should stay home and I can take all the supplies. How's that for an excellent offer?  All for me and 0 for you.",Rejecting the compromise and making a sarcastic counter-offer
casino,491,8,mturk_agent_1,train,"I think it would be good to come to a compromise. If I take all of the water and have the 2 foods, you can take all of the firewood as you originally proposed. Yet, I will have a tough time learning how to survive on a camping trip.😡",Proposing another compromise and expressing frustration
casino,491,9,mturk_agent_2,train,"Again, that's not a fair compromise....You get all of what we both we want and more of another item.  Let me state it to you clearly so you can understand.  I WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT OFFER.  There is no chance you are getting all the water now that I think about it.  I will offer I get 1 water, 2 firewood, and 2 food.  If you can't come up with a reasonable offer, I will just walk away and we both get nothing.  I will survive because I will have skills.",Rejecting the compromise and issuing an ultimatum
casino,491,10,mturk_agent_1,train,"I think this is reasonable because you have a big family. I will accept 2 waters, 1 firewood, and 1 food.",Accepting a compromise and acknowledging the other’s needs

There will be a lot of standing water, so my chances for having safe water to drink might be a little iffy.",Request a package of water and express gratitude for the firewood.
casino,105,2,mturk_agent_2,train,Well I planned on spending a few extra days here at this camping site with my family so the extra water will really come in handy for me over the next few days.

casino,105,3,mturk_agent_1,train,That makes total sense.  I will let you keep all 3 of the water packages.

I really appreciate your generosity 🙂.,Agree to the proposal and express appreciation.
casino,105,4,mturk_agent_2,train,"No problem.🙂  So I will keep the 3 packages of water and, since I am giving you all 3 packages of the firewood I will take back the 1 food package and keep all 3 of the food packages.",Confirm the new distribution and adjust the food allocation.
casino,105,5,mturk_agent_1,train,"I would still like at least 1 package of the food please.

casino,105,6,mturk_agent_2,train,You don't have to eat the poison mushrooms. You can catch some fish from the river or hunt for small animals.  You have all of the firewood so cooking the food should not be a problem.,Suggest alternative food sources and downplay the need for extra food.
casino,105,7,mturk_agent_1,train,"I won't willingly eat the poisonous mushrooms, but it could be very hard to tell the difference from safe and toxic ones.  I understand you will be staying in your area for a few extra days, but can you catch fish or hunt for small animals in your area too?",Express concern about identifying safe food and inquire about the other party's ability to hunt or fish.

casino,508,7,mturk_agent_2,train,"Since I am giving you all of the firewood that you said was most important to you, I feel I should get at least the same amount of items as you, especially since you are getting exactly the firewood you want. I will need to stick to three waters and two food.",Justifying the need for an equal amount of items and sticking to the initial offer

casino,438,9,mturk_agent_2,train,"I could live with that but I'd need to get one firewood.

casino,474,2,mturk_agent_1,train,"Hmmm, I think I really need the firewood.  I brought softwoods and they burn out quickly so I don't think I'll have enough wood to keep me going through the night.

casino,474,5,mturk_agent_2,train,Hmm unfortunately I can't budge since I would be accepting less of my top priority item.

casino,449,7,mturk_agent_1,train,"Hmm, that's not favorable for me going by the volume of items left in my arsenal. Water is more of a higher priority than food. So, I would exchange 1 pack of food for an additional water",Express concern about the fairness of the trade and propose a counteroffer
casino,449,8,mturk_agent_2,train,So that way you would get two waters and two foods? Those are my priorities as well but i would be ok with it since that way i would get five items and you would get only four.,Clarify the terms of the trade and express willingness to compromise

casino,100,6,mturk_agent_1,train,I understand. We will have a big group (about 10 people) so we are trying to have as much water as possible as well. If anyone gets dehydrated it'd be the end of the trip and hard to get everyone back to base. What's the fewest amount of bottles you're willing to accept?,Express understanding and inquire about the minimum acceptable water packages
casino,100,7,mturk_agent_2,train,"😮Two packages is the lowest I would accept.  There is one exception to that.  If you were willing to give up 2 firewood, then I would be willing to take 1 water.  I think I could trade some extra firewood for water at the campsite.",State the minimum acceptable water packages and propose a trade involving firewood
casino,100,8,mturk_agent_1,train,"I understand. I am not willing to give up any firewood, but I'd be willing to do a trade of 1 food for 1 water. So 3 firewood for us, 1 water for us, and 1 food for us.",Decline the firewood trade and propose an alternative trade involving food and water
casino,100,9,mturk_agent_2,train,"Sorry, that won't work for me. ☹️ My counteroffer is I will take three waters and two food packages and give you all of the firewood and 1 food.  I am running out of time, and if we don't agree, we will both lose out, so please consider this last offer.🙂",Reject the alternative trade and make a final counteroffer

casino,104,5,mturk_agent_2,train,"Interesting , because my group feels the same way though. How does your group feel about water though?",Express a similar need and inquire about the importance of water for the other group
casino,104,6,mturk_agent_1,train,Water is not that important for us but the firewood is a deal breaker for us ☹️,State the lesser importance of water but emphasize the critical need for firewood

casino,104,10,mturk_agent_1,train,That is kind of excessive though.... 6 - 3 of an item share?,Express concern about the fairness of the new proposal
casino,104,11,mturk_agent_2,train,Well you wanted the firewood so take it or leave it.,Issue an ultimatum regarding the proposed distribution
casino,104,12,mturk_agent_1,train,"Can we do 5 - 4? and 2 fire wood , 1 food and 1 water for me?",Propose a counter-offer for a more balanced distribution
casino,104,13,mturk_agent_2,train,No😡,Reject the counter-offer
casino,104,14,mturk_agent_1,train,Please its really unfair... The items are still in your favor. My family really needs the firewood and some additional water and food would make our day so much better. You are still coming out on top with excess supplies.,Appeal for fairness and explain the impact on their family
casino,104,15,mturk_agent_2,train,"I guess, I can do that deal...",Reluctantly agree to the proposed deal
casino,104,16,mturk_agent_1,train,Thank you so much! 🙂,Express gratitude for the agreement

casino,154,1,mturk_agent_2,train,"Aww I'm sorry to hear that, it sounds like it might be better to have her bring her own food. I'll be bringing my teenage son so it would be awesome to get any extra food for him that I can. You know how they be! 🙂",Expressing sympathy and suggesting the friend bring her own food  while requesting extra food for their teenage son.
casino,154,2,mturk_agent_1,train,What about I take 2 of the packages and you take 1? I know teenagers also drink a lot of water haha 🙂,Proposing a compromise of taking 2 food packages and giving 1 to the other person.
casino,154,3,mturk_agent_2,train,"He definitely does drink a lot of water, but he's in a growth spurt so 2 would be ideal. I'm happy to give up all firewood in exchange for the extra food!",Explaining the son's high food needs and offering to give up all firewood in exchange for extra food.

casino,154,7,mturk_agent_2,train,Oh no! Moms can always be so forgetful. I do notice that leaves you with 6 items and me with 3 though. I think it might be better if I take the 2 waters to make it more equal.,Sympathizing with the situation and pointing out the imbalance in item distribution  suggesting a more equal distribution.
casino,154,8,mturk_agent_1,train,"Hm, I didn't think about that. Good point.",Acknowledging the point made by the other person.

casino,539,2,mturk_agent_2,train,"I am! Now, I need a lot of firewood because we were planning on burning some earlier (to start cooking meals and such). I also need some extra food in case bugs come and eat some (like last trip, ugh). How about I take 2 firewood, 2 food, and you take 3 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food?",State needs and propose a resource distribution plan
casino,539,3,mturk_agent_1,train,"Would you be open to taking 1 less firewood, I would give you 1 food for it. The weather is supposed to be extra chilly and we did not bring warm enough sleeping bags so we need the extra firewood to avoid freezing to death!",Negotiate for more firewood by offering a trade
casino,539,4,mturk_agent_2,train,"No, I would need more water if I were to take that deal.",Counter the negotiation with a new condition
casino,539,5,mturk_agent_1,train,hmmm I am not willing to give that up. I think I would stick to your original proposal.,Reject the counteroffer and revert to the original proposal

casino,542,4,mturk_agent_2,train,Me too. Firewood is the most important thing to me. We will be somewhere cold and we could use the extra warmth.,Agree with the desire for fairness and express the importance of firewood due to cold conditions.
casino,542,5,mturk_agent_1,train,"True.  How about I get 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood. And that will leave you with 2 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food?",Propose a specific distribution of resources.
casino,542,6,mturk_agent_2,train,What do you need the extra water for?,Question the need for extra water.
casino,542,7,mturk_agent_1,train,With the extra food I need I will need extra water also.  How about I only take 1 extra water?,Justify the need for extra water and propose a compromise.
casino,542,8,mturk_agent_2,train,"So are you okay with you getting 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood and me getting 1 food, 2 water and 2 firewood? I'll do that deal.",Confirm the proposed distribution and express willingness to agree to the deal.
casino,542,9,mturk_agent_1,train,That should work.  I will conserve with my water and I should be fine.  So we have a deal?,Agree to the proposed distribution and seek final confirmation of the deal.
casino,31,0,mturk_agent_2,train,"Hello, how is your camping trip going?",Initiate conversation and inquire about the other person's camping trip.
casino,31,1,mturk_agent_1,train,"Hi there.  Hoping it'll be good, and yours as well.

casino,31,2,mturk_agent_2,train,I don't have any problems letting you have all 3 waters. Would you be willing to give me all 3 firewood? I need extra to keep me warm as I get cold easily.,Agree to give all 3 waters and propose a trade for all 3 firewood due to personal need for warmth.
casino,31,3,mturk_agent_1,train,"That's a little tough for me but if we can come to an agreement where I get 2 of the food, I'd be willing to play ball.  We both deserve a good camping trip, after all.",Express difficulty with the proposed trade and counteroffer by requesting 2 food items  emphasizing mutual benefit.
casino,31,4,mturk_agent_2,train,That's true. We both deserve a good trip. Why do you need more food?,Seek clarification on the need for more food.
casino,31,5,mturk_agent_1,train,"Because I planned to go hiking and it wouldn't leave me time to chop much of any myself.  Even if I did, I'd have to carry it back and that's obviously not very smart in this heat.  But if I had the extra food, I'd be willing to inconvenience myself with getting firewood and cutting my hike a little short because I know the firewood is important to you.",Explain the need for more food due to hiking plans and offer a compromise by agreeing to gather firewood despite the inconvenience.
casino,31,6,mturk_agent_2,train,"You're right. I do not plan on hiking so you need more food than me. If I am correct, would I get 3 firewood/1 food while you get 3 water/2 food?",Acknowledge the reasoning and confirm the proposed trade details.

casino,185,4,mturk_agent_1,train,sure,Agree to the counter-offer
casino,185,5,mturk_agent_2,train,That is awesome. I really appreciate it.,Express gratitude

casino,178,1,mturk_agent_2,train,That doesn't really work for me because then I would get only 2 waters and nothing else ☹️. What do you think is your highest priority?,Expressing disagreement and asking for priorities
casino,178,2,mturk_agent_1,train,Wood is my highest priority. I need it to stay warm. I'm very cold-natured. What is your highest priority? 🙂,Stating highest priority and asking for the other’s priority
casino,178,3,mturk_agent_2,train,Oh that's good. Wood is not my highest priority since I get hot easily lol. My highest priority is probably food because I have a very high metabolism and get very hungry,Stating own priority and providing a reason
casino,178,4,mturk_agent_1,train,"I understand that. I also need food though, because I need the sustenance to help warm me up. So maybe 3 firewood 1 food and 2 waters for me?",Expressing understanding and proposing a revised deal
casino,178,5,mturk_agent_2,train,"I still don't think that is too fair though, since you would be getting 6/9 of the extra items and I would only be getting 3... I'm not an avid camper so I need extra amenities to make sure I survive haha. I am flexible on the water though - maybe we can compromise there. I am fine with you having all of the wood. Maybe we could give you 3 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water?",Expressing disagreement  explaining reasoning  and proposing a compromise
casino,178,6,mturk_agent_1,train,That sounds very fair to me. Thank you for being understanding. 🙂,Agreeing to the compromise and expressing gratitude

casino,178,9,mturk_agent_2,train,"Haha maybe! I am afraid of some bugs though, especially ticks 😮",Expressing a concern humorously
casino,178,10,mturk_agent_1,train,"Yes, you have to check EVERYWHERE for ticks! And since we've come to an agreement, I will submit our deal!",Providing advice and indicating action to finalize the deal
casino,526,0,mturk_agent_2,train,"Hello, I would really like to get most of the water and firewood packages.",Express desire to obtain most of the water and firewood packages
casino,526,1,mturk_agent_1,train,You can have most of the water and firewood if I can have most of the food. I would like to get two of the firewood so I have a nice fire to come back to after searching for a source of water.,Propose a trade-off by offering most of the water and firewood in exchange for most of the food
casino,526,2,mturk_agent_2,train,"How about I take all off the water, 1 firewood and 1 food package? 🙂",Counter-propose by requesting all the water  1 firewood  and 1 food package

Thankfully I was able to scare it away with noise. However, ever since then I've brought a lot of wood with me so no bears can sneak up on me.
